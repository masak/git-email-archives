Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 19, 2005 at 01:23:24AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Getting tags is probably nice. You should definitively not get
.git/heads, though. Those are your private stuff mostly, and the HEAD
you "export" is .git/HEAD.

I'm thinking about this yet, since it might be useful to be able to
export multiple branches without needing to set up multiple rsync
URLs... you still don't want the heads/ directory en block, though.
