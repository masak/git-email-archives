This is assuming that you only have one replace and no other operations 
recorded in the patch. If you have multiple replaces or a replace and a 
traditional diff  recorded in the same patch, then this is not true.

See above for one set of limitations on this. A more fundamental problem 
comes back to intent. If I have a file "foo" before:
a1
a2
and after:
b1
b2
is that a "replace [_a-zA-Z0-9] a b foo" patch, or is that a
-a1
-a2
+b1
+b2
patch? Note that this comes down to heuristics, and no matter what you 
use, you will be wrong sometimes,  *and* the choice that is made can 
substantively affect the contents of the repository after additional 
patches are applied.

It's provable that you can not.
