I would suggest something like /pub/scm/kernel/git/<people> on 
kernel.org.  This is easy to do, and being outside the "mirrored 
worldwide" set shouldn't cause anyone any issues.

/pub/linux/... is mirrored worldwide and that might cause some 
consternation.

If this is OK with everyone I'll try to set them up (I'm at LCA at the 
moment, so I might have limited connectivity at any one particular 
moment in time.)
