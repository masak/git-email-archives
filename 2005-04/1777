Btw, I've also been pretty disgusted by SCM's apparently generally caring 
about stuff that is totally not relevant.

For example, it seems like most SCM people think that merging is about
getting the end result of two conflicting patches right.

In my opinion, that's the _least_ important part of a merge. Maybe the 
kernel is very unusual in this, but basically true _conflicts_ are not 
only rare, but they tend to be things you want a human to look at 
regardless.

The important part of a merge is not how it handles conflicts (which need
to be verified by a human anyway if they are at all interesting), but that
it should meld the history together right so that you have a new solid
base for future merges.

In other words, the important part is the _trivial_ part: the naming of
the parents, and keeping track of their relationship. Not the clashes.

For example, CVS gets this part totally wrong. Sure, it can merge the 
contents, but it totally ignores the important part, so once you've done a 
merge, you're pretty much up shit creek wrt any subsequent merges in any 
other direction. All the other CVS problems pale in comparison. Renames? 
Just a detail.

And it looks like 99% of SCM people seem to think that the solution to 
that is to be more clever about content merges. Which misses the point 
entirely.

Don't get me wrong: content merges are nice, but they are _gravy_. They
are not important. You can do them manually if you have to. What's
important is that once you _have_ done them (manually or automatically),
the system had better be able to go on, knowing that they've been done.
