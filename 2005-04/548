What's wrong with the contents of the glibc-kernheaders package? Can you
file specific bugs if you're having problems?

In the long run, the answer is to convince Linus that we _really_ need
the kernel to have a set of header files defining the ABI which are fit
for public consumption, rather than having a horrid mix of private and
exportable bits throughout the contents of the include/ directory. 

In the meantime, some poor mug has to clean the crap up and try to make
something suitable to live in /usr/include/linux -- and unfortunately at
the moment for Fedora that someone is me :)

Unless git is doing something with kernel-private headers that it
shouldn't, this probably wants to be discussed elsewhere -- most likely
in Bugzilla.
