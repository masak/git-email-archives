I do not personally like that '-m' thing either so please feel
free to drop it.  I was just toying with the idea.  I knew you
would not use "-m" yourself (and I would not myself either).
The patch was primarily meant for Pasky to raise his opinion.
If having something like this helps Cogito then he can keep it.
If Cogito will be doing the "show-files --unmerged" with
"cat-file blob" itself and this "checkout-cache -m" does not
help it that much then there is no point having this hack.

I do not mind your dropping the "warning" bit, but please keep
the skipping bit for "-a".  Dropping that TT from stage 1 into
the working directory and then complaining that TT exists when
it then tries to extract stage 2 and stage 3 is simply madness.

Yes.  I think that is the right thing to do.  In fact the idea
is quite similar to what I've been working on, which is a
rewrite of that perl thing to use "read-tree -m O A B".
