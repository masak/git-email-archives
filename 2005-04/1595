"register" and "auto" variables aren't relicts of the 60's,  they're a 
part of the ISO-C 99 standard, I'm following, "man".

And if you think "register" variables are outdated, please remove the 
CONFIG_REGPARM option from the Kernel source.

Removing a "//" comment makes sense in this case because a "//" comment 
between hundrets of "/* */" comments looks extremly ugly and shows that 
the source is "patchworked" and unstructured.

Today a lot of people forget about the basic rules of coding. You too. :)
