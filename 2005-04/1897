Yes. I _think_ the right thing to do ends up being something like the 
update script doing

	diff-tree -r $orig $final | grep '^-'

at the end to get the list of deleted files, and just doing 'rm' on the 
result.

One problem with this is that "grep" always thinks lines end in '\n', and 
what we'd really want (from a scriptability angle) is

	diff-tree -z -r $orig $final | grep -0 '^-'

but I don't think you can tell grep to think that lines are
zero-terminated instead of terminated with \n'. But I don't see how to do
that with grep.

Another similar alternative is to use "show-files --others" before and
after the merge and seeing what files got added to the list of "files we
don't track", but that just sounds horribly hacky.

Anyway, there are clearly at least two ways of doing this, and we'll just
have to have people work on the scripts to do it right..
