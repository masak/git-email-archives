Well, it would work if the dontdiff file other people are maintaining 
was made up of regexps.  But it is made of shell wildcard patterns meant 
to be used with the -X switch of the diff command.

Indeed.  And yesterday I realized that the (currently unimplemented) 
--ignore switch to show-files, combined with the exclusion pattern list, 
whould be more logical than teaching show-diff (which I still think is a 
misnamer in the context of the other diff tools) about files unknown to 
the cache.  The patch to show-files is also much smaller and logical.

BTW, I don't do this out of pure entousiasm but rather trying to make my 
own workflow with the Linux kernel source tree more efficient in the 
context of git usage.  My pure coding entousiasm lies somewhere else.
