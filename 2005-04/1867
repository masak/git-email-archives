Dear diary, on Wed, Apr 27, 2005 at 08:22:07PM CEST, I got a letter
where Alan Chandler <alan@chandlerfamily.org.uk> told me that...

Those commands affect your working tree:

	cg-cancel
		Cancels out any modifications in the working tree w.r.t.
		the last commit
	cg-merge
		Merges changes done in another branch to your current
		branch
	cg-patch
		Applies a patch, with regard to special git-specific
		info generated by cg-diff
	cg-rm
		Removed the file from your working tree if it's still
		around
	cg-seek
		Changes your working tree to match some other commit in
		the database
	cg-update
		Potentially brings in changes from a remote branch, and
		updates your working tree to the latest commit + those
		changes

Those commands affect the objects database:

	cg-commit
	cg-pull
		cg-pull just gets the data from remote objects database
		to the local objects database; it is the "first part"
		of what cg-update does
	cg-update

This affects both:

	cg-merge
		Not directly, but it can call cg-commit automatically.
	cg-update

You didn't do make install and you don't have the cogito tree in your $PATH.
