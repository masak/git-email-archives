Dear diary, on Sat, Apr 23, 2005 at 08:43:12PM CEST, I got a letter
where James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@SteelEye.com> told me that...
> One of the features I found most useful about bk changes was the ability
> to see changes in my tree that weren't in the other tree (I use this to
> keep track of what patches I actually have).
> 
> I've modified the gitlog script to take the -L and -R options (local
> directories only; won't work on remotes like bk changes would) to add
> this functionality.

Linus isn't probably the right person to Cc on this, since this is
git-pasky thing.  Can you please post it as a signed-off patch?

I don't get what are you doing anyway. I don't know the "bk changes"
tool. Can't you just do

	git log theothertree yourtree

?
