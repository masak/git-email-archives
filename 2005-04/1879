   I know that.  However, is that going to be true for all versions of the 
   repository format over all time?  If so, the repository format is brittle.

I think one has to understand Linus' posts as coming from the
"head-down, steaming ahead for *MY* project cause you all suck"
perspective and impose corresponding filters on his declarations of
"LAW".  At least that's the only way *I* can make sense of his latest
contributions.

If you get git, just do the right thing -- Linus be damned.
