I disagree. This already forces you to have two branches (one to pull
from to get the data, mirroring the remote branch, one for your real
work) uselessly and needlessly.

I think there is just no good name for what pull is doing now, and
update seems like a great name for what pull-and-merge really is. Pull
really is pull - it _pulls_ the data, while update also updates the
given tree. No surprises.

(We should obviously have also update-without-pull but that is probably
not going to be so common so a parameter for update (like -n) should be
fine for that.)

These naming issues may appear silly but I think they matter big time
for usability, intuitiveness, and learning curve (I don't want git-pasky
become another GNU arch).

Kind regards,
