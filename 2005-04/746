I, at least, would REALLY like to see _highly_ portable C code;
I'm looking at git as a potential long-term useful SCM tool for
LOTS of projects, and if you're going to write C, it'd be nice
to just write it portably to start with. There's certainly
no crisis in using separate declarators.

In fact, in the LONG term I'd like to see the shell code
replaced with code that easily runs "everywhere" (Windows, etc.),
again, for portability's sake.  I think that would be unwise to
do that right now; the shell is an excellent prototyping tool.
But once things have settled down & there's been some experience
with the tools, the pieces could be slowly recoded.
(Yes, I know of & use Cygwin. And I prefer Python over Perl,
but I'm really uninterested in language wars.)
