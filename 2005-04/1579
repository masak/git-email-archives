man env:

The first remaining argument specifies the program name to invoke;
it is searched for according to the `PATH' environment variable.  Any
remaining arguments are passed as arguments to that program.

It's a trick to do a PATH search for a script interpreter rather than 
hard coding the path.
Now all we have to do is make sure every distro on the planet has 
/usr/bin/env - and they do.
