That's exactly what I wanted. Q'n'D is how the ball gets rolling.

In the meantime I wrote a very stupid "merge-tree" which does things
slightly differently, but I really think your approach (aka my original
approach) is actually a lot faster. I was just starting to worry that the 
ball didn't start, so I wrote an even hackier one.

My really hacky one is called "merge-tree", and it really only merges one 
directory. For each entry in the directory it says either

	select <mode> <sha1> path

or

	merge <mode>-><mode>,<mode> <sha1>-><sha1>,<sha1> path

depending on whether it could directly select the right object or not.

It's actually exactly the same algorithm as the first one, but I was 
afraid the first one would be so abstract that it (a) might not work and 
(b) wouldn't get people to work it out. This "one directory at a time with 
very explicit output" thing is much more down-to-earth, but it's also
likely slower because it will need script help more often.

That said, I don't know. MOST of the time there will be just a single 
"directory" entry that needs merging, and then the script would just need 
to recurse into that directory with the new "tree" objects. So it might 
not be too horrible.

But I'm really happy that you seem to have implemented my first 
suggestion and I seem to have been wasting my time.

You missed one case: 

    5.0.1 if both heads change it to the same thing, take the new thing

but maybe you counted that as 5.0 (it _should_ fall out automatically from
the fact that "diff-tree" between the two destination trees shows no
difference for such a file).

Now, arguably, your 5.2 will do things right, but the thing is, it's 
actually fairly _common_ that both heads have changed something to the 
same thing. Namely if there was a previous merge that already handled that 
case, but that previous merge may not be a proper parent of the new 
commits.  So from a performance standpoint you really don't want to 
consider that to be a merge - you just pick up the new contents directly.

See?

(My stupid "merge-tree" should show the algorithm in painful obviousity. 
Of course, my stipid merge-tree may also be painfully buggy. You be the 
judge).

That sounds good.

Yes. My "merge-tree" needs the exact same thing.

Looks good from your explanation, but I'm too tired to look at the code. 
It's 1AM, and the kids get up at 7.

I'm not much of a hacker, I usually crash by 10PM these days ;^)
