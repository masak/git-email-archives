I fully agree with the intent of the field separation, they're two very
different activities.

braddr:x:1000:1000:Brad Roberts,,,:/home/braddr:/bin/bash

All gecos entries on all my debian boxes are of the form:

   fullname, office number, office extension, and home number

This is taken from the chfn man page on debian.  Looking on my nearest
redhat box, the chfn man page is roughly the same.  Debian's man page also
has one snippit that's not in redhat's, suggested delimiter is a ','.  A
bit of searching for other platforms, aix suggests a ';' as a delimiter.
HPUX seems to want a ','.

Later,
Brad
