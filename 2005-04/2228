That's a nice idea. We may add the owner of the repo to this file too?
Or where does your script know that from the permissions? Is the projects
overview page updating itself?


Here is a new gitweb.cgi version that integrates with that page. The
own project browser is removed now and the top-link points now to your
link-list.

!! It already uses the new binaries with the git-* prepended. !!

See it working here:
  http://ehlo.org/~kay/git/

Get the cgi from here:
  ftp://ehlo.org/git/gitweb.cgi

!! Just remove lines 26-30, which are the settings to run on my box. !!

Thanks,
Kay
