Well, except for the fact that that isn't machine-readable either, since 
the "1 " thing might just be part of the filename..

But you could use "/" to guarantee that it's unique, together with knowing
that git refuses to have non-canonical filenames.

Ie 1//filename.c _would_ be machine-readable, thanks to the "//" part,
which cannot be part of a valid canonical git filename.
