The reason I don't want this is that if the commands keep on silently
fixing things like this up, then performance will go down the toilet.

What _should_ happen is that you do an "update-cache --refresh" before    
doing the diff-cache. That way you do _not_ end up having to check the    
sha1 match over and over again if you just did a "touch" on the file.

In other words, you're adding bandage for a problem that shouldn't exist,
and you're doing it in a way which means that _if_ the problem exists,    
you'll never fix it, but you'll just rely on your bandage all the time.

So cogito definitely does not have to jump through any hoops at all. It
should just make sure to keep the cache up-to-date if it ever cares (ie
do "update-cache --refresh"). 

Some commands obviously won't care.
