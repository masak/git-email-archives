I really don't know. I'm actually very happy where this thing is right
now, and completing that first merge successfully was a big milestone to
me personally. That said, actually _using_ this thing is not for the
faint-of-heart, and while I think "git" already is showing itself to be
useful, I'm very very biased.

In other words, I really wonder what an outsider that doesn't have the
same kind of mental bias thinks of the current git tree. Is it useful, or
is it still just a toy for Linus to test out his crazy SCM-wannabe.

Can people usefully track my current kernel git repository, or do you have
to be crazy to do so? That's really the question. You be the judge. Me,
I'm just giddy from a merge that was clearly done using interfaces that
aren't actually really usable for anybody but me, and barely me at that ;)

Btw, I also do want this to show up in the BK trees for people who use 
BitKeeper - the same way we always supported tar-ball + patch users 
before. So I'll have to try to come up with some sane way to do that too. 
Any ideas? The first series of 198 patches is obvious enough and can be 
just done that way direcly, but the merge..
