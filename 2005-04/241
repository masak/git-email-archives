You didn't need one - I just didn't want to merge your "ls-tree" change
without making things be consistent. Once we started using the "-z" flag 
for ls-tree, it just didn't make any sense not to do the same thing for 
diff-tree.

Just a heads-up - I'd really want to do the same thing to "merge-tree.c" 
too, but since you said that you were working on extending that to do 
recursion etc, I decided to hold off. So if you're working on it, maybe 
you can add the "-z" flag there too? 

I'm actually holding off merging the perl version exactly because you 
seemed to be working on the C version. I don't mind perl per se, but if 
there's a real solution coming down the line..
