Yes.

Yup:

	t: line 5:  3853 Broken pipe             cat /etc/termcap
	t: line 5:  3855 Broken pipe             cat /etc/termcap

Didn't change anything for me. Same thing.

It will also grep out any occurrence of "Broken pipe", so if we're talking 
about a kernel changelog, where we fix a pipe bug...

I don't know why the bash people have that stupid pipe reporting in the 
first place, considering that no other shell seems to do it, and everybody 
just wants to shut it up..
