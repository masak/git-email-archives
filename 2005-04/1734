I'm the one who has been trying very hard to keep the output
machine readable (remember? many of the -z flags are mine).

While I agree with you that we should somehow show the stage, I
do not like your suggestion above very much.  How about adding
one column for stage number before the filename when --unmerged
is given, just like show-files --stage shows?  You'd soon get
used to the pattern that has a single digit in between
whitespaces to recognize which is merged and which isn't.
E.g. this is from show-files --stage:

    100644 b258508afb7ceb449981bd9d63d2d3e971bf8d34 1 MM
    100644 b431b272d829ff3aa4d1a5085f4394ab4d3305b6 2 MM
    100644 19989d4559aae417fedee240ccf2ba315ea4dc2b 3 MM
    100644 a716d58de4a570e0038f5c307bd8db34daea021f 0 MN

Another thing I'd like to rectify is that show-files use a space
while diff-tree and friends use a tab in between columns.  Is it
too late to standardize one way or the other?  My vote goes to
a space.
