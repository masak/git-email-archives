So why not just do 'git init URL' to get the upstream sources, make your edits,
do 'git pull' to track the upstream sources every once in awhile, and do 'git
diff' when you're ready to send your changes to the upstream maintainer.

I think I've understood your explanation of what's actually happening, but I
still don't see its significance. What do you get from a fork that you don't get
from a regular old init and pull?

Be well,
Zack
