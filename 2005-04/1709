Yeah, what I was wondering about was the scenario where a user does (and
pardon any errors, I haven't actually used cogito) something like

cd foo
cg-init http://remote_repository
cd ../bar
cg-init ../foo

(so far we've only got hard links and everything is great)

http-pull http://remote_repository (downloads a few more commits to bar)
cd ../foo
http-pull http://remote_repository

Does this last pull download the same commits as the previous one? Ideally
it wouldn't.  The whole point of the sha1-named files is that you don't
have to worry about where you got it from.  Ideally the second pull would
get the actual files from ../bar, where they've already been downloaded.

Or perhaps (and this was what I was *really* hoping) all the cogito remote
operations would store a hardlink of their results in a common cache
directory, so that one could actually do

cd foo
cg-init http://remote_repository
cd ../bar
cg-init http://remote_repository

without either downloading anything twice, or wasting any disk space.  In
practice what's more likely in practice is that you'll want to

cd foo
cg-init http://linus_remote_repository
cd ../bar
cg-init http://gregkh_remote_repository

and would like to avoid downloading redundant info.
