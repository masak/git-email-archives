Thanks.  Not honoring "--add" was an oversight on my part.

My pleasure.  I am currently not that interested in toilet part
than I am interested in plumbing part, so rebasing my tree back
to yours is no problem for me.  Currently I see your HEAD is at
461aef08823a18a6c69d472499ef5257f8c7f6c8, so I will generate a
set of patches against it.
