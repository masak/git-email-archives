It *is* incredibly stupid, but dates back to the fact that a the GMT 
offset field in struct tm is a reasonably recent invention, and a lot of 
old code depended on just stuffing fields in struct tm and calling 
mktime(); they would leave the offset field uninitialized, as opposed to 
setting it to some well-defined "I don't know" value.

What totally blows is that if mktime() can't be fixed, that we haven't 
added mktime_have_offset() or something like that.

Oh well.  If you have the offset, the algorithm is fully arithmetric and 
doesn't rely on the zoneinfo system, so it can be trivially implemented. 
   And again, curl_gettime() does handle the whole string to time_t 
conversion of the common formats.
