  Hello,

  I'm happy to announce that the Cogito rsync location changed to

	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/cogito.git

  Please update your .git/remotes accordingly.

  Also please note that the Cogito download location changed too. From
now on, Cogito releases will appear at

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito

or

	ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito

  Please update your bookmarks, if you have any.

  This will hopefully make me fit to my bandwidth limit until the end of
the month, and should make things significantly faster for you. Thanks a
lot to the kernel.org folks who made it possible!
