You really don't want that.

The thing is, somebody doing a "touch" on a file should _not_ cause that 
tree to be committed as a new tree.

Trying to save mtime in a git archive is about a million times worse than 
saving the whole "mode" information, and there we already ended up cutting 
it down to just one bit, exactly because it was horrible not to.

So this is not about git formats, this is about it just not being 
practical to do. Git simply isn't a good thing to store mtime in.
