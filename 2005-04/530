David did the commits-mailing-list script and I'm working on a
commits web-page like what was formerly seen at:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/cset/
(with daily tarball)

based on some older scripts from David, however I'm wondering if
a variant of the gitlog.sh script wouldn't be a better starting
point for it.
