Dear diary, on Fri, Apr 15, 2005 at 02:58:25AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

No, $(tree-id) is the "destination branhc", what the user directory is
based upon; $merged is the branch you are merging now, relative to
$base. When I throw away the useless "-b" argument, in practice it would
look like

	merge-trees abcd 1234 5678

for doing

      /------ 1234 -+-
abcd <             /
      \------ 5678

(not that the order of 1234 and 5678 would actually really matter)

I fear I don't understand the rest of your paragraph. :-(

What about the conflicts? Like one tree deleting, other tree modifying?
