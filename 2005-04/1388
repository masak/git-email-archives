Ideally a hash + collision-count pair would make the best key, rather 
than just hash alone.

A collision -will- occur eventually, and it is trivial to avoid this 
problem:

	$n = 0
	attempt to store as $hash-$n
	if $hash-$n exists (unlikely)
		$n++
		goto restart
	key = $hash-$n

Tangent-as-the-reason-I-bring-this-up:

One of my long-term projects is an archive service, somewhat like 
Plan9's venti:  a multi-server key-value database, with sha1 hash as the 
key.

However, as the database grows into the terabyte (possibly petabyte) 
range, the likelihood of a collision transitions rapidly from unlikely 
-> possible -> likely.

Since it is -so- simple to guarantee that you avoid collisions, I'm 
hoping git will do so before the key structure is too ingrained.
