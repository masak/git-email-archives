Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 17, 2005 at 07:36:51AM CEST, I got a letter
where Steven Cole <elenstev@mesatop.com> told me that...

Could you please send your patches inline? (Either in the body or with
correct content-disposition header.)

You got the return values other way around and you are missing a
copyright notice at the top; you should also mention that you take no
parameters.

Please use -s instead of -e, since it is more appropriate in this case.
Also, you should report the "no remotes" message to stderr. And always
exit when you found that .git/remotes exists, not only if cat succeeds.

Kind regards,
