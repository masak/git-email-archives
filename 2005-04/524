You don't need a kernel.org account to rsync it... this works too:

rsync -avz -e ssh --progress --ignore-existing  rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/torvalds/linux-2.6.git/ .git/

It's currently just 2.6.12-rc2 (17,000 files) plus changes...

Two people have announced full history gits if you are interested
in that...  Check the git email archives for mail from Ingo Molnar:
Subject: full kernel history, in patchset format

and Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>:
