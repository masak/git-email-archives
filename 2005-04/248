So you want to merge someone else's tree into your committed state, and
then merge the result with your working directory to get the working
directory you continue with, provided that the second merge is trivial?

Are you thinking that the best common ancestor is the one that ties up
absolutely all of the chains of commits, or the closest one that the sides
have in common? I have the feeling that the former isn't going to be
useful, because there will be lines you're considering merging which go
back to ancient kernels, where they keep merging in your changes, but
they still have a lineage back to 2.6.0 or something.

For the latter, there are sometimes multiple ancestors which fit this
criterion, and different ones of them are most helpful for different
portions of the merge. I think this primarily happens when a branch you
want to merge has accepted multiple patches that you've also
accepted (and the history identifies this fact); this may or may not be a
situation you want to allow on a regular basis.
