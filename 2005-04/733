Here is perhaps a better way to provide detailed help for each
git command.  A command.help file for each command can be
written in the style of a man page.

The modfication to the main git script will be trivial. 
Here are the two commands I've done so far.

What do folks think about this approach?

[steven@spc git-pasky]$ ./git help add
NAME
        add - Add new file or files to a GIT repository.

SYNOPSIS
        add FILE...

DESCRIPTION
        Takes a list of file names at the command line, and schedules them
        for addition to the GIT repository at the next commit.

AUTHOR
        Written by Petr Baudis.

REPORTING BUGS
        Report bugs to <git@vger.kernel.org>

COPYRIGHT
        Copyright (c) Petr Baudis, 2005

BUGS
        Those files are omitted from show-diff output!

SEE ALSO
        The source code for this command is gitadd.sh.

[steven@spc git-pasky]$ ./git help addremote
NAME
        addremote -  Add new "remote" to the GIT repository.

SYNOPSIS
        addremote RNAME RSYNC_URL

DESCRIPTION
        Takes the remote's name and rsync URL.

        After you add a remote, you can "git pull" it whenever you want
        and it will keep your dircache in sync with it. Its latest commit
        is accessible as .git/heads/remotename (or - more conveniently -
        as $(commit-id remotename)). For example, to make a diff between
        Linus (after you added him) and your current tree, do

        git pull linus
        git diff $(commit-id linus)

TODO
        gitdiff.sh et al should accept remote names as ids.

SEE ALSO
        The source code for this command is gitaddremote.sh.
