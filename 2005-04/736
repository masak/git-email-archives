Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 19, 2005 at 03:40:54AM CEST, I got a letter
where Steven Cole <elenstev@mesatop.com> told me that...

I don't like it. I think the 'help' command should serve primarily as a
quick reference, which does not blend so well with a manual page - it's
too long and too convoluted by repeated output.

I'd just print the top comment from each file. :-)
