If it does, it's not because of n_link; see previous email.

I have used ext2 filesystems with hundreds of thousands of files per 
directory back in 1996.  It was slow but didn't break anything.

The only filesystem I know of which has a 2^16 entry limit is FAT.

The base64 version has 2^12 subdirectories instead of 2^8 (I just used 2 
characters as the hash key just like the hex version.)  So it ascerbates 
the performance penalty of subdirectory hashing.
