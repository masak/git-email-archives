That's true. I think I actually like "git pull" as the operation for "make
sure I have everything I need, so I can lose net".

I think that having "git update" update a tracked branch is best, if only as
an aid to discoverability. And "git merge" should require you to say what
you want to merge with, because it's too easy to pick a wrong default, and
the user had better know.

It seems to me like this makes "update" identical to "merge <tracked>", so
"update [NAME]" and "merge" don't make sense, since they'd do the other
command, but less intuitively.
