Reliability is a must have, but disk space matters in the real world if 
all other things are roughly equal. And bandwidth requirements are 
certainly another real issue if they result in significant delay.

Isn't the important thing  having the SCC reliable and easy to use, as 
in supports the things you want to do without jumping through hoops? One 
advantage of Mercurial is that it can be the only major project for 
someone who seems to understand the problems, as opposed to taking the 
time of someone (you) who has a load of other things in the fire. And if 
there isn't time to do all the things you want, perhaps generating a 
wisj list and stepping back would be a good thing.

If you have the energy and time to stay with git, I'm sure it will be 
great, but you might want to provide input on Mercurial and let it run.

PS: I don't think the performance difference is enough to constitute a 
real advantage in either direction.
