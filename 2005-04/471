Essentially, yes.

It's actually kind of tricky to get all of the "best" ancestors without
getting any useless ancestors; the "best" criterion is maintained in the
current version by stopping as soon as possible.

I think that the real solution would be to have a merge program that
interacts back and forth with the revision history processor, since I
think that merges for which the choice of ancestor matters (for whether it
gives a conflict) would benefit most directly and clearly from figuring
out the histories of the conflicting changes, not choosing different
ancestors.

If someone comes up with an algorithm that wants an alternative ancestor
rather than more interactive stuff, I can work on getting a complete list.

I tried with just one, but I couldn't keep it straight in my
head. rev1list holds the unmarked ancestors of rev1; rev2list holds the
unmarked ancestors of rev2.

Sure.

No, this is normal; it indicates that tree 1 has a recent little merge:

orig --------------- tree 2
 \
  --- X -- Y -- Z -- tree 1
       \       /
        -- A --

When we see X for A, we've already seen it for Y, but that's fine. I get
this case when I merge with you after you merge twice with Linus since I
last merged.

Ah, details; mainly, I want to wait until revision.h is cleaner before
fixing this sort of thing.

Sure.

Fixed version to follow.
