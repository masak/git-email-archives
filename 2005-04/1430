This is _still_ corrupted. 

Are you editing your diffs by hand without understanding how the diffs 
work?

The second chunk of the "git-merge-one-file" diff _still_ claims to change 
twelve lines, and that diff _still_ only changes eleven lines. My "patch" 
isn't happy, and I can count the lines in the diff myself and verify that 
it's not patch that is wrong, it's your diff.

Please please _please_ don't edit diffs by hand if you don't know what 
you're doing. Generate the diff from a clean source instead. Or ask me to 
fix it up, I'm so used to editing diffs that I can do it in my sleep.
