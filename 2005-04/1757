Bzzt. Wrong answer.

The _right_ answer is "if one person moves a function, and another person 
modifies the function, the changes should be applied to the moved 
function".

Which is clearly a _much_ more common case than file renames.

In other words, if your algorithm doesn't handle the latter, then there is 
no point in handling the former either.

And _if_ your algorithm handles the latter, then there's no point in 
handling file renames specially, since the algorithm will have done that 
too, as a small part of it.
