I realize that there is probably a law that there has to be a space, but I 
actually personally use tab-completion all the time, and in many ways 
prefer a name that can be completed without having to play games with 
magic bash completion files.

So how about using a dash instead of a space, and making things be

	cg-pull
	cg-update

etc? You can link them all to the same script if you don't like having 
multiple scripts, and just match with

	case "$0" in
	*-pull)
		...
		;;
	*-update)
		...
		;;

or something.

Yeah, yeah, it looks different from "cvs update", but dammit, wouldn't it 
be cool to just write "cg-<tab><tab>" and see the command choices? Or 
"cg-up<tab>" and get cg-update done for you..

Just because rcs/cvs/everybody-and-his-dog thinks it is cool to have a 
space there and have different meaning for flags depending on whether they 
are before the command or after the command doesn't mean that they are 
necessarily right..

Just an idea,
