commit-id doesn't really use cat-file; the way it calls gitXnormid.sh
definitely suppresses that section. In fact, commit-id with no arguments
is simply an easy-to-remember way of doing "cat .git/HEAD" using a much
more complicated script. Earlier, I sent a patch to just do this, since it
avoids the whole issue.

(Also, .git/HEAD is a dependancy, since you want to redo the version
script if you commit; but if you don't have it, that's okay and just means
you're building from a tarball, which is described completely by VERSION)
