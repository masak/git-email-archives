I think show-diff with path restriction (if restriction is
simple), or piping its output to grep or filterdiff (otherwise),
would be enough to do what you do here, so personally I doubt
this new command is even useful that much.

That said, I have a couple of comments.  Other than these I do
not see anything majorly wrong (although I haven't even compiled
it yet ;-).

If you are trying to do something similar to show-files by these
-[acdo] flags, matching these flags in both commands would be
less confusing to the users and script writers.  Either make
diff-files take fully spelled --others etc. that show-files
takes, or submit a patch for show-files to match these shorter
ones as well.  I personally prefer the latter.

For that logic, instead of doing de->d_name[0] == '.' and things
yourself, I'd rather see you lift verify_path() function from
update-cache.c into common library and call it.  Then if the
"likely will not change" part needs to be updated, you do not
have to worry about it; updates to verify_path() would take care
of it for you.
