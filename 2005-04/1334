Hi,

It wasn't that long ago that the pasky git tree was relocated.  This 
required a modification to the .git directory in a local pull.  A dns 
system could be built to ensure the following:

A) quick easy lookup of archive locations
B) handle changes of repository location
C) add mirror support

So heres the plan...
I do a lot of work in sip/voip field, and our approach to handling backup 
proxies and routers is to use a dns srv record.

Here's how it works for voip/sip.

_{protocol}._{transport}.{name}.hostname.org

A sample lookup:

dig SRV _sip._udp.proxy-dca.broadvoice.com


;; QUESTION SECTION:
;_sip._udp.proxy-dca.broadvoice.com. IN SRV

;; ANSWER SECTION:
_sip._udp.proxy-dca.broadvoice.com. 86400 IN SRV 1 0 5060 
proxy.mia.broadvoice.com.
_sip._udp.proxy-dca.broadvoice.com. 86400 IN SRV 0 0 5060 
proxy.dca.broadvoice.com.


Now of course we could null out some of those fields and swap sip for git 
and udp for rsync, then replace proxy.foo to rsync://host/path/to/git. 
Since we're using rsync, mirroring is simplified by just rsyncing the 
trees.
