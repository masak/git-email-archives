If you look carefully, ../cogito/.git/heads contains several files, one of
which is "mycogito", and the symlink in mycogito/.git/HEAD is to that one,
while the one in cogito/.git/HEAD is to a different one. So, while HEAD
points to a file in a shared directory, each fork points to a different
file.

The changes affect only the "mycogito" head, not the original head. On the
other hand, the files generated by the commit are accessible from the
original directory, so you can diff between your new head and the original
or mainline successors of it.

Now you commit in your directory. This gives you a new head for
mycogito. You can then do "git patch pasky" (or something of the sort,
check the help for the details) to get a patch for the your changes. You
can also do multiple commits and generate either a single patch or patches
corresponding to each commit.

In general, you want to use "merge" when you've got local commits. You
also want to commit before doing this, so that you have a known state
for your version to revert to if you mess up merging.
