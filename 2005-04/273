remember that the flap over SHA1 being 'broken' a couple weeks ago was not 
from researchers finding multiple files with the same hash, but finding 
that it was more likly then expected that files would have the same hash.

there was qa discussion on LKML within the last year about useing MD5 
hashes for identifying unique filesystem blocks (with the idea of being 
able to merge identical blocks) and in that discussion it was pointed out 
that collisions are a known real-life issue.

so if collision detection is turned on in git, does that make it error out 
if it runs into a second file with the same hash, or does it do something 
else?
