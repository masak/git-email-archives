I think I only saw a cut-and-paste version, and I didn't want to follow
that pattern.

That was just silly; on the other hand, I think I'll eventually want to
have a "support-for-merging" library file, so that people can write
alternative merging programs which call library functions to pick out
history details. But that obviously shouldn't be the same file that
rev-tree and fsck share, and I'll probably do that by pulling main() out
of the program later.

I think there is some value in having a library file that completely
parses "commit"-tagged files. Having the date field in struct revision
without the code to parse it in the file that defines the struct seems
poor to me.

I'm not actually using the date in merge-base, either, so I'll just leave
that alone for now (merge-base is based on generations, not time,
currently).
