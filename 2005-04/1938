GNU diff uses an algorithm which is tuned to handle finding the shortest
diff among a large set of similar-length alternatives while comparing
files which have a lot of repeated lines. The author of the paper it cites
is really thinking about diffing DNA sequences or similar things. It also
can't detect content moves, which are a common thing to have, and which
will be important in the long run, when we're trying to track
modifications to content which also moved from place to place.
