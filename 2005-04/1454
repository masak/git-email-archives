I'm just offering it as one of the scripts I need to operate a git tree
as a maintainer.  I don't have git-pasky installed, so I can't patch it
against anything.  However, feel free to incorporate any pieces you
need.

No idea .. not used it.  However, how does this show the -L and -R diffs
since there are two possible views of changes between trees?  It's
primarily -L (changes in local) I need to keep the changes in my local
tree.  -R (changes in remote) is just useful to show what changes I'm
missing and might need to merge.
