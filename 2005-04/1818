Nice... your new version takes 4.413 seconds on my G5 for 1000MB,
compared to 4.606 for your old version, i.e. it's about 4.4% faster.
Unfortunately it gives the wrong answer, though.

On my powerbook, which has a 1.5GHz G4 (7447A), the same test takes
4.68 seconds with my version, 4.72 seconds with your old version, but
only 3.90 seconds with your new version.

Care to check the code and find out why it's giving the wrong answer?

Regards,
Paul.
