Actually I'm not sure that's true. Let's consider the two main users of
this information.

Firstly, because it's what I've been playing with: to list a given
file's revision history, I currently work with its filename -- walk the
commit objects, inspecting the tree and selecting those commits where
the file has changed. If my filename is 'fs/jffs2/inode.c' then I can
immediately skip over a commit where the 'fs' entry in the top-level
tree is identical to that in the parent, or I can skip a commit where
the 'jffs2' entry in the 'fs' subtree is identical to the parent... it's
all done on filename, and the {parent, entry} tuple wouldn't help much
here; I'd probably have to convert back to a filename anyway.

Secondly, there's merges. I've paid less attention to these (see mail 5
minutes ago) but I think they'd end up operating on the rename
information in a very similar way. To find a common ancestor for a given
file,, we want to track its name as it changed during history; at that
point it's all string compares.
