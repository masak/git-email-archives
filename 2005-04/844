Start by putting it in at "read-tree" time, and adding the code to
invalidate all parent directory indexes when somebody changes a file in
the index (ie "update-cache" for anything but a "--refresh").

That would be needed anyway, since those two are the ones that already
change the index file.

Once you're sure that you can correctly invalidate the entries (so that
you could never use a stale tree entry by mistake), the second stage would
be to update it at "write-tree" time.
