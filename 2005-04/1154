Dear diary, on Thu, Apr 21, 2005 at 09:00:09PM CEST, I got a letter

git cancel will give you "plain last commit". If you need plain vanilla,
the "hard way" now is to just do

	commit-id >.git/HEAD

but your current HEAD will be lost forever. Or do

	git fork vanilla ~/vanilla linus

and you will have the vanilla tree tracking linus in ~/vanilla.

I'm not yet sure if we should have some Cogito interface for doing this
and what its semantics should be.

Actually, in case your tree is older than about two days, I hope you did
the convert-cache magic or fetched a fresh tree?
