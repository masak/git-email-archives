So?

What do you intend to do with all the other stuff I've already put on top?

Yes, I can undo my tree, but my tree has had more stuff in it since I 
pulled from you, so not only will that confuse everybody who already got 
the up-to-date tree, it will also undo stuff that was correct.

In other words, HISTORY CANNOT BE UNDONE.

That's the rule, and it's a damn good one. It was the rule when we used
BK, and it's the rule now. The fact that you can undo your history in
_your_ tree doesn't change anything at all.

So I can merge with your new tree, but that won't actually help any: I'll 
just get a superset, the way you did things. 

The way to remove patches is to explicitly revert them (effectively
applying a reverse diff), but I'm wondering if it's worth it in this case. 
I looked at the patches I did get, and they didn't look horribly bad per 
se. Are they dangerous?

2.6.12 is some time away, if for no other reason than the fact that this 
SCM thing has obviously eaten two weeks of my time. So I'd be inclined to 
chalk this up as a "learning experience" with git, and just go forward.
