It looks like you'll only see the commits on ext3 when the log fills, and on 
reiser3 you'll see it every 5 seconds or when the log fills.  With the 
default mount options, both ext3 and reiser will flush the data blocks at the 
same time they are writing the metadata.

The easiest way to get around this is to mount -o data=writeback on 
ext3/reiser, but you'll still have to wait for the data blocks eventually.
