  Hello,

  so here finally goes git-pasky-0.5, my set of scripts upon Linus
Torvald's git, which aims to provide a humanly usable interface, to a
degree similar to a SCM tool. You can get it at

	http://pasky.or.cz/~pasky/dev/git/

  See the READMEs etc for some introduction.

  This contains plenty of changes, it's difficult to sum it up. It has
been reworked to better support the concept of branches; you can create
local branches which share the GIT object repository by git fork. There
is also git init which will yet you start a new GIT object repository
(possibly seeding it from some rsync URL), git status, better git log,
much cleaner concept of tracking (and consequently simpler yet better
git pull). Of course it contains the latest updates from Linus' branch
too.

  There is also git merge, which does some merging, but note well that
it is vastly inferior to what we _can_ do (and what I will do now).
Expect 0.6 soon where git merge will actually make use of the merging
facilities. I released 0.5 basically only because I have been postponing
it so long that I really feel ashamed of myself. ;-)

  Have fun,
