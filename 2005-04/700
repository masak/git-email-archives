It should definitely be able to do that. 

Do a "git log | less" to look up the trees involved, and do a "git diff
<parent-tree> <child-tree>" to see the output. If you don't see your new
file, then either you have an old "git diff" that doesn't like the new
tools (and you need to add a "-z"  flag to diff-tree), or you didn't 
check in the new file successfully ;)

You can also always do "tree-diff -r old-tree new-tree" which will show
you the tree-level changes. That's the low-level plumbing stuff: it 
doesn't show you the actual file contents, just how the tree changed.

That should already be the case now after the latest diffs from Junio.

Looks ok, which seems to mean that your scripts are buggered since they 
didn't pick up the new file.

Merge pushed out.
