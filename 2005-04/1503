Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 24, 2005 at 05:47:54PM CEST, I got a letter
where Zack Brown <zbrown@tumblerings.org> told me that...

git seek, without any arguments.

Perhaps we should prohibit absence of arguments and add 'unseek'?

Actually, this _would_ work:

	git init ../mygitdir/.git

Then, you would need to git pull to get the latest changes.

git fork seconddeveloper ../mygitdir

Git does not record renames, and neither does Cogito (for now).

Try head git*.sh. ;-)

Assuming that it is tagged, just do

	commit-id linux-2.6.12-rc3

or whatever the tag name is. From Cogito perspective, you can use the
symbolic name anywhere you would use the proper string.

There is also tree-id and parent-id, with same usage.

	git log previous that

Any ideas how to improve the user interface further are deeply
appreciated. (However please note that it is going to undergo a big
change in an hour or two, so you might want to postpone them until
that.)
