this issue was raised a few days ago in the context of someone tampering 
with the files and it was decided that the extra checks were good enough 
to prevent this (at least for now), but what about accidental collisions?

if I am understanding things right the objects get saved in the filesystem 
in filenames that are the SHA1 hash. of two legitimate files have the same 
hash I  don't see any way for both of them to exist.

yes the risk of any two files having the same has is low, but in the 
earlier thread someone chimed in and said that they had two files on their 
system that had the same hash..
