I take it back, it works just fine... 

My problem was that bk generates dates with a non-rfc compliant timezone
string.  And I was trying to apply patches exported from bk in plain
text format (building a udev git tree...)  The patch below to
commit-tree.c fixes this issue, if anyone runs into this same issue (I
wouldn't recommend it to be applied, as it's probably a one-off
issue...)

thanks,

Allow commit-tree to handle the bk date format.
