Ok, I hate to do this, since my fingers have already gotten used to the 
old names, but we clearly can't continue to use command names like 
"update-cache" or "read-tree" that are totally non-git-specific.

So I just pushed out a change that renames the commands to always have a 
"git-" prefix. In addition, I renamed "show-diff" to "diff-files", with 
together with the prefix means that it becomes "git-diff-files" when used.

Since I end up using tab-completion for almost all my work, and since
-within- the source directory there's no confusion, I didn't actually name
the source files with any git- prefix. Quite the reverse: I removed the
prefix from the two .c files that already had it (so git-mktag.c is now
just "mktag.c"), and the general rule for building the executable from a C 
file is now

	git-%: %.c $(LIB_FILE)
		$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(filter %.c,$^) $(LIBS)


this seemed to be a nice regular interface that means that binaries get 
installed with clear "git-" prefixes, but that I don't have to look at 
them when I edit the sources.

Sorry to everybody else whose fingers have already learnt the old names. 
The good news is that if you use cogito, you won't care.
