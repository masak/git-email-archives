(Sorry about that last e-mail.  gnome-terminal crashed and sent the file
before I edited it.  Here's what I meant to send.)

Unfortunately, the blocks are connected by a data dependency.
It's basically a large-key block cipher, chained by:

iv[] = fixed_initial_value.
iv[] += encrypt(iv, text[0..63])
iv[] += encrypt(iv, text[64..127])
iv[] += encrypt(iv, text[128..191])
iv[] += encrypt(iv, text[192..255])
etc.

There is no coarse-grain parallelism to exploit, unless you want
to be hashing two separate files at once.  Which would do too much
damage to the structure of the source to be worth considering.

I don't quite think it's worth it, though.  It's not data-parallel
enough.

We could theoretically use it to form the w[] vector, but that's only
4 instructions in registers which are very flexibly schedulable and
nicely fill in the cracks between other instructions.

Oh, here's STEPD1+UPDATEW scheduled optimally for the G4.  %r5 holds the
constant K.  Note that t < s <= t+16.  W(s) and W((s)-16) are actually
the same register.

add   RE(t),RE(t),W(t);	xor    %r0,RD(t),RB(t);	xor    W(s),W((s)-16),W((s)-3);
add   RE(t),RE(t),%r5;	xor    %r0,%r0,RC(t);	xor    W(s),W(s),W((s)-8);
add   RE(t),RE(t),%r0;	rotlwi %r0,RA(t),5;	xor    W(s),W(s),W((s)-14);
add   RE(t),RE(t),%r0;	rotlwi RB(t),RB(t),30;	rotlwi W(s),W(s),1;

However, whether that can be done in 6 cycles on a G5 is a bit unclear.
It can't be 6 consecutive cycles, but with some motion of code
across the edges, perhaps...

0: add   RE(t),RE(t),W(t);		xor    %r0,RD(t),RB(t);
1: xor    W(s),W((s)-16),W((s)-3);	(add)
2: add   RE(t),RE(t),%r5;		xor    %r0,%r0,RC(t);
3: xor    W(s),W(s),W((s)-8);		(rotlwi)
4: add   RE(t),RE(t),%r0;		rotlwi %r0,RA(t),5;
5: xor    W(s),W(s),W((s)-14);		rotlwi RB(t),RB(t),30;
6:
7: add   RE(t),RE(t),%r0;
8:
9: rotlwi W(s),W(s),1;

The problem there is forcing that ordering, rather than issuing the final
add in cycle 6 and pushing everything else ahead of it.


STEPD0+UPDATEW and STEPD1+UPDATEW are 13 and 14 instructions,
respectively, and don't fit into a 3-issue machine as neatly.
