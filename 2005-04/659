Currently, the fsck-cache code is unpacking the objects to find out what
type they are, and the old code would pass the unpacked objects to the
parsing code. The new code doesn't take the unpacked objects, so it
unpacks them again. (I.e., fsck-cache will look at each object exactly
twice). The right solution is to have the internals reorganized slightly
such that a "parse_object" method, which does what fsck-cache wants (i.e.,
parse this object regardless of what type it is, and tell me the type),
could be fit in efficiently. But it doesn't affect the header file
interface, and it's only relevant to fsck-cache, which wants to look at
random junk that it doesn't have a reference to.
