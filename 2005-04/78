No. git is not an SCM. it's a filesystem designed to _host_ an SCM, and 
that _is_ doing it right from the beginning.

Keep the abstractions clean. Do _not_ get confused into thinking that git 
is an SCM. If you think of it that way, you'll end up with crap you can't 
think about.

And at a filesystem layer, "rename" already exists. It's moving an object 
to a new name in a tree. git already does that very well, thank you very 
much.

But a filesystem rename is _not_ the same thing as an SCM rename.  An SCM 
rename is built on top of a filesystem rename, but it has its own issues 
that may or may not make sense for the filesystem.
