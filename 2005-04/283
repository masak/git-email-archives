Dear diary, on Sat, Apr 16, 2005 at 11:45:59AM CEST, I got a letter
where Russell King <rmk@arm.linux.org.uk> told me that...

this is was a problem with git apply, which did not apply mode changes
correctly until recently. If you have no local changes,

	checkout-cache -f -a

should fix this. Hopefully.

I personally don't think I like the mode tracking at all. Some people
(Linus?) may want to have group +w. Other people (me) have their default
group as 'users', and I definitively don't want everyone to be able to
write to the files. :-)

I think we should track only whether the file is executable or not.
Linus?
