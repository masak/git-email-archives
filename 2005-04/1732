True.

The idea is that it should appear if you're building a version that has
changes in its .git; in this case, VERSION is insufficient to tell you
which revision you have installed. If I've got cogito-0.8 + three untagged
commits from the remote repository + two local patches, I'd like to be
able to tell if the installed version is cogito-0.8 + two of the remote
patches. Possibly, it should also suppress the SHA1 if you've got a tagged
head, but identifying this situation is tricky, currently. Eventually, it
should be able to use a cg program to update VERSION from .git/HEAD and
include SHA1 for cases which aren't directly tagged.

I like your version.
