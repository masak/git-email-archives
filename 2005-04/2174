I know that you mentioned other things.  That doesn't invalidate that Noel
was talking about your starting point description of how git works and
suggesting that it isn't how git actually works.  The relevance of your
other points depends upon having the base model correct.

You can argue that glass houses are inherently brittle, but why should I
care if mine is already made of bricks instead of glass?  If the model
against which you are arguing is not the model which is used by git, then
the model isn't a relevant basis for claiming problems with git.
