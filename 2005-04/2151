Well, I guess *you* didn't read carefully.  I also spoke about the
value of passing around triples: ancestry, diff, and tree.  The
question is about linking signatures to things that humans can
reasonably *intend* and be reasonably held accountable for, hence one
of the values of signed diffs.  (I cited other practical reasons to
value signed diffs and use them in specific ways, too.)
