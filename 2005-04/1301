Hmm. I'm not sure about throwing away the <objecttype> information in
the url. I think I'd prefer to retain the blob, tree and commit
namespaces because I think they help API users to explicitly state what
kind of object they expect. I can't think of a scenario where I'd want a
<sha1> of unknown type. Do you have a specific use case in mind ?
