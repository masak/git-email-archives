It seems to me like there should be a set of variables for the user in
general, and the various git scripts should arrange them appropriately
(e.g., git apply could look for a first Signed-Off-By, and make the
AUTHOR_ variables match that (for the next commit), while making the
COMMITTER match the user, etc). It seems to me like the current situation
is likely to lead to people claiming to be other people when applying
their patches, just due to having set up their correct info for handling
their own patches.

Actually, if the scripts are reorganizing them, they might as well send
them on the command line.
