While we're at it, I'll just mention that '\0' is a rather bad delimiter 
for zlib-compressed files; it usually ends up enlarging the file by three 
or more bytes compared to using any whitespace character.  The reason is 
obvious: \0 isn't actually used anywhere else in the compressed contents, 
so it tends to pollute zlib's dictionary.

It's probably too late to do anything about this, but hey.
