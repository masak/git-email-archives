You haven't looked at git, have you?

Git already merges better than _any_ open-source SCM out there. It just 
does it so effortlessly that you didn't even realize it does that.

Today I've done four (count them) fully automated merges on the kernel
tree: serial, networking, usb and arm.

And they took a fraction of a second (plus the download of the new
objects, which is the real cost).

This is something that SVN _still_ cannot do, for example.
