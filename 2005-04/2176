Hi Tom,

I hope I am not speaking out of turn or misinterpreting issues beyond my grasp,
but my perception of git is that when you sign a commit, you guarantee that this
is indeed the next step in the chronology of your own branch.  It's not about
diffs; it's about a singular brachial chronology - of course, additional
information may be recorded about topological antecedents, but that's not what
the signature is about.  The diff from that chronology can easily be generated
and scrutinized by anyone, and imported or not into another branch.

Cheers,
