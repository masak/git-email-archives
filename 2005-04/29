Thanks for the kind words.

Actually I am not handling that.  It really is 5.1a---the exact
same code path as 5.1 can be used for this case, and as you
point out it is really a quite important optimization.

I have to handle the following cases.  I think I currently do
wrong things to them:

  5.1a both head modify to the same thing.
  5.1b one head removes, the other does not do anything.
  5.1c both head remove.
  5.3 one head removes, the other head modifies.

Handling of 5.1a, 5.1b and 5.1c are obvious.

  5.1a Update dircache to the same new thing.  Without -f or -o
       flag do not touch ,,merge-temp/. directory; with -f or
       -o, leave the new file in ,,merge-temp/.

  5.1b Remove the path from dircache and do not have the file in
       ,,merge-temp/. directory regardless of -f or -o flags.

  5.1c Same as 5.1b

I am not sure what to do with 5.3.  My knee-jerk reaction is to
leave the modified result in ,,merge-temp/$path~ without
touching dircache.  If the merger wants to pick it up, he can
rename $path~ to $path temporarily, run show-diff on it (I think
giving an option to show-diff to specify paths would be helpful
for this workflow), to decide if he wants to keep the file or
not.  Suggestions?
