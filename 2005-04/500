The way to handle that is that you need to 

 - remember (or re-fetch) what the latest HEAD was that you merged with in 
   my tree.

   if you didn't remember, you can just get all my objects and do a

	merge-head $(cat .git/HEAD) $linus-current-head

   or something (using the current git archive that has a "merge-head" 
   program. That gives you the most recent common head.

 - use "rev-tree" to show reachability

	rev-tree $my-current-head $last-merge-head
		| sort -n		# sort by date rather than sha1
		| cut -d' ' -f2		# get the sha1 + "flags" mask
		| grep :1		# show the ones that are only
					# reachable from $my-current-head

and you now have a nice list of sha1's ordered by date.

Or something. I didn't test the above. Testing is for users.
