Come to think of it, the option I was thinking of is orthogonal to your
option; I was thinking of an option to read the head from the sending
side's file, rather than from the command line.

In any case, if you're sharing the repository by HTTP, there's no hurry to
update the HEAD right after, since the old head doesn't stop being valid
(although it's obviously not going to be current in a moment).

For the rpull case, what you want is to just say "HEAD" (or something),
and the remote server will send you the HEAD and you pull down that
commit. You're probably right that you don't want to automatically write
it to the local HEAD, though, although the future format should give us
somewhere good to put the result.

That was actually my motice in getting rpush/rpull/http-pull in, too.

If you're going to do much serious with this, you should probably remove
the if (has_sha1_file()) continue;" bit in process_commit(), so that it
will make sure that the repository gets pulled completely with -a, even if
some commits have already been pulled. (This will make things less
efficient, but less error-prone, and we'll fix the inefficiency later.)
