One of the features I found most useful about bk changes was the ability
to see changes in my tree that weren't in the other tree (I use this to
keep track of what patches I actually have).

I've modified the gitlog script to take the -L and -R options (local
directories only; won't work on remotes like bk changes would) to add
this functionality.

#!/bin/bash
#
# Make a log of changes in a GIT branch.
#
# This script was originally written by (c) Ross Vandegrift.
# Adapted to his scripts set by (c) Petr Baudis, 2005.
# Major optimizations by (c) Phillip Lougher.
# Rendered trivial by Linus Torvalds.
# Added -L|-R option by James Bottomley
#
# options:
# script [-L <dir> | -R <dir> |-r <from_sha1> [ -r <to_sha1] ] [<sha1>]
#
# With no options shows all the revisions from HEAD to the root
# -L shows all the changes in the local tree compared to the tree at <dir>
# -R shows all the changes in the remote tree at <dir> compared to the local
# -r shows all the changes in one commit or between two
