I guess really that's the issue.  Get itself is a special case that we've
already optimized for the initial get.  You'll also run into trouble using
pull to grab an entire plain old darcs repository with a large initial
commit.  We can (and should) also optimize pull, but it's not going to ever
be as efficient as a get is, for the case where you start with an empty
repository.

The output of linesPS actually does take a huge amount of space.
