They do things somewhat differently, so it would be more intrusive. Could
I send an extra patch to convert them instead of doing them here?

Yeah, that's left over from the not-quite the same parsing code in the
other programs.

I'd actually like to make them commit.{c,h}, since the system calls the
things they actually deal in commits, not revisions. But this is getting
into stuff that's likely to cause painful divergance from Linus's repo,
which is why I'm a bit leary of actually doing it now.
