Why do you think so? IMHO we should always target a similar number of
files/subdirectories in a directories of the blob archive. So If I
always suppose that the archive would contain at most 16 millions of
files then the possible indexing schemes are either 1 level with key
length 3 (each directory would contain ~4096 files) or 2 level with key
length 2 (each directory would contain ~256 files).
Which one is better could be of course filesystem and hardware
dependent.

Of course it might be best to allow adaptive indexing but I think that
first some benchmarking should be made and it's possible that some fixed
scheme could be chosen as optimal.
