Except, I believe, MicroEMACS, which both Linus and myself use.  As
far as I know, there aren't any patches to make it UTF-8 compliant.

The alternative is, I suppose, iconv.  However, iconv in _my_ glibc
seems buggy (segfaults) and my efforts for building glibc 2.3.2 for
ARM have failed.  Effectively that means iconv is inaccessible to
me.
