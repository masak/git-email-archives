I don't think anybody preferes the original behaviour - the reason 
git-pull-script punted with any non-trivial merge was that when I wrote 
the damn thing, I was still just testing out the merges, and I definitely 
didn't trust the automated script.

However, when you remove the "checkout-cache -f -a" thing, it means that 
you are leaving all teh checked-out files in a state where it's _very_ 
easy to mess up later, and doign so silently really is very bad.

So at the _very_ least you should do an "update-cache --refresh", and 
_tell_ the user about the files that are checked-out but not up-to-date.

And it really sounds like the whole and only reason you don't like 
checkout-cache is that you normally work with an empty tree, so I actually 
think that the _right_ answer for you is to add a new flag to 
"checkout-cache" that only updates files that already exist. Something 
like "-n" for "don't create new files".
