Looks like you are right.

The seconds are already in UTC format, so I think "git log" is wrong to 
pass the UTC seconds in to "date", and then tell date that it was done in 
the original timezone.

I think it would be nice to use the TZ data to show the thing in the 
timezone of the committer, though. Dunno how to do that, maybe something 
like

	TZ=$tz date -d "1970-01-01 + $sec sec"

or whatever. Sadly, it looks like "date" doesn't understand timezone 
syntax like that - looks like TZ has to be in the long machine-unreadable 
format like "US/Pacific" etc. Stupid (either TZ or me - maybe I just 
don't know what the right format is).
