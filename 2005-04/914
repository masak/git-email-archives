For future reference, this is in the wrong order.

You should have "checkin comment" first, then "signed-off-by", then a line 
with three dashes, and then "administrative trivia".

Ie I'd much rather see the email look like

	Normalize init-db environment variable handling, allowing the creation
	of object directories with something other than DEFAULT_DB_ENVIRONMENT.
	
	Signed-Off-By: Zach Welch <zw@superlucidity.net>

	This patch applies on top of:
	        [PATCH 1/3] init-db.c: cleanup comments
	
	 init-db.c |   11 +++--------
	 1 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 8 deletions(-)
	
	.. actual patch goes here ..

since otherwise I'll just have to edit it that way. I like seeing the 
administrative stuff (diffstat etc), but I don't want to have it in the 
commit message, and that's exactly what the "---" marker is for - my tools 
will automatically cut it off as if it was a signature (or the beginning 
of the patch).
