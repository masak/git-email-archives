Note that git _does_ very efficiently (and I mean _very_) expose the 
changed files.

So if this kind of darcs patch is always the same pattern just repeated
over <n> files, then you really don't need to even list the files at all.  
Git gives you a very efficient file listing by just doing a "diff-tree"  
(which does not diff the _contents_ - it really just gives you a pretty
much zero-cost "which files changed" listing).

So that combination would be 100% reliable _if_ you always split up darcs 
patches to "common elements". 

And note that there does not have to be a 1:1 relationship between a git
commit and a darcs patch. For example, say that you have a darcs patch
that does a combination of "change token x to token y in 100 files" and
"rename file a into b". I don't know if you do those kind of "combination 
patches" at all, but if you do, why not just split them up into two? That 
way the list of files changed _does_ 100% determine the list of files for 
the token exchange.
