Fixed extra vertical whitespace, Copyright notice problems, and issue
with git help ci.

Here's a better version.  Didn't fix the more interesting bugs, as I'm
pressed for time (aren't we all).  Perhaps someone can polish this up.

Anyway, I think it's pretty useful in its present form.

This patch will provide the comment lines in the shell script associated
with the command, cleaned up a bit for presentation.

BUGS: This will also print any comments in the entire file, which may
not be desired.  If a command name and shell script filename
do not follow the usual convention, this won't work.
