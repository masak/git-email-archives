Shrug, we shouldn't need help from the kernel for something like this.  git as 
a database hits worst case scenarios for almost every FS.

We've got:

1) subdirectories with lots of files
2) wasted space for tiny files
3) files that are likely to be accessed together spread across the whole disk

One compromise for SCM use would be one packed file per commit, with an index 
that lets us quickly figure out which commit has a particular version of a 
given file.  My hack gets something close to that (broken into 32k chunks for 
no good reason), and the index to find a given file is just the git directory 
tree.

But my code does hide the fact that we're packing things from most of the git 
interfaces.  So I can almost keep a straight face while claiming to be true 
to the original git design...almost.  The whole setup is far from perfect, 
but it is one option for addressing points 2 & 3 above.
