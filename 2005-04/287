It would certainly be nice to change to a hash of the uncompressed 
content, rather than a hash of the compressed content, but it's not 
strictly necessary, since files are fetched all at once: there's not 'read 
subrange' operation on blobs.

I assume 'merkle hash tree' is talking about:
   http://www.open-content.net/specs/draft-jchapweske-thex-02.html
..which is very interesting, but not quite what I was thinking.
The merkle hash approach seems to require fixed chunk boundaries.
The rsync approach does not use fixed chunk boundaries; this is necessary 
to ensure good storage reuse for the expected case (ie; inserting a single 
line at the start or in the middle of the file, which changes all the 
chunk boundaries).

Further, in the absence of subrange reads on blobs, it's not entirely 
clear what using a merkle hash would buy you.
