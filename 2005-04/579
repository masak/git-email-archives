I don't think it's much different in difficulty, plus it handles more
(parsing the objects more completely). They'll follow.

I think that should be easy, although I haven't written code to do it. If
you output the whole history, sorted by date, you obviously need to get 
the whole history, but I expect people will have some sort of pruning to
keep it down to a size they care about.

Haven't written that yet, but I can do so.
