Now you're just being an ass. I stated, flatly, that what you're proposing
to have done (by you or whoever, for feasibility it doesn't matter which)
is not going to happen due to just plain difficulty. You obviously
disagree with me, but rather than coming out and saying so you're
pretending I didn't make that statement.

So you think that a system which supports snapshots and history but has no
merging functionality whatsoever is the right thing? I'm asking this
seriously. You have a magic --make-somebody-else-do-merge command, but for
everybody else the current state of things is workable as a stopgap
measure (the original plan) but very painful for anything more.

Codeville is comparable in terms of number of lines of code to Git, by the
way.

You were happy with BitKeeper, so why should we? Monotone and Codeville
are only just about now really mature, and you aren't exactly known as a
model customer.

I'm trying to tell you that the amount of time between now and when a
system as nice as BitKeeper is in use by the kernel can be dramatically
reduced by either using an existing system verbatim or basing new efforts
on one.

If you think that git as it exists right now is at all comparable to
Monotone or Codeville you're completely delusional.

Now you've just gone off the deep end. This is an apples-to-apples
comparison. Please accept one of thee following two statements:

(a) Git doesn't do merging, and none of the related new tools around it do
merging.

(b) Codeville merge (sans rename functionality) would be superior for the
merging which will be done.
