  Hi,

  note that in my git tree there is a git merge implementation which
does out-of-tree merges now. It is still very trivial, and basically
just does something along the lines of (symbolically written)

	checkout-cache $(diff-tree)
	git diff $base $mergedbranch | git apply
	.. fix rejects etc ..
	git commit

  It seems to work, but it is only very lightly tested - it is likely
there are various tiny mistakes and typos in various unusual code paths
and other weird corners of the scripts. Testing is encouraged, and
especially patches fixing bugs you come over.

  It is designed in a way to make it possible to just replace the
checkout-cache and git diff | git apply steps with the merge-tree.pl
tool when it is finished.

  Thanks,
