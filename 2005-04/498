That's a good point. I'll require a -t for now, and add more later.

Well, -c -t would give you the current tree and the whole commit log, but
not old trees. -a would additionally give you old trees.

The problem is that, if you've fetched the final commit already, and then
the server dies, and you try again later, you already have the last one,
and so you think you've got everything.

At this point, I also want to put off doing much further with recursion
and commits until revision.h and such are sorted out.
