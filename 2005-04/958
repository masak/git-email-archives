With a chunked file, you can also skip writing certain *subtrees* of the 
file as soon as you notice it's already present on disk.  I can code this 
up if you are interested.

Of course, the paranoid folks will give up any performance benefit you 
obtain if they keep their "yes the SHA1 matches, but is the file *really* 
the same" code.  But maybe they're willing to be slow -- and they can do 
an uncompress rather than a compress in order to do the comparison, which 
will give *some* performance improvement.
