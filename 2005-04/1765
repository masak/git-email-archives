I'd even go so far as to say that we need to have the user sign off on
this. The modification is reasonably likely to not work in the new
location, due to use of statics that aren't available or something of the
sort.

I suspect that we want to report a conflict in the new location between
the old version and the new version, and let the person merging check
whether the change is okay. That is, both sides modified the same section
at the same time: one side modified its content, while the other modified
its location. We can give a good suggestion, but we need a final ruling.
