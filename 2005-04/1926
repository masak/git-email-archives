Dear diary, on Wed, Apr 27, 2005 at 12:25:58AM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

Did you (or any other kernel developer reading this) actually try the
Codeville merge? (I admit I didn't get time to do anything real with it
yet.) SCM people keep praising it (as basically the best (at least
open-source) merge out there), so it would be interesting to compare
that with the actual real-world experience with it on the kernel.

I think SVN is just irrelevant here - it is a completely different
league. The contenders here are probably Codeville, Monotone and perhaps
GNU Arch offsprings.
