Nope. They are reported in the order they are found, which is not 
meaningful at all (it depends on the directory ordering, with the 
highest-level bits being obviously ordered by the sha1 number thanks to 
the subdirectory stuff).

So you can only see the name of the tag - there's no ordering. The 
tag-name may of course imply an ordering in itself..

It even says so: "expect dangling commits".

The tags will always be dangling, since nothing refers to them. Once you 
have them listed in your tag database (ie you've created files that 
mention them in .git/refs/tags or something), you can tell fsck about 
them, and fsck won't complain. 

Something like

	fsck-cache --unreachable $(cat .git/refs/*/*)

would do it (and depending on exactly how cogito ends up recording them).
