If you want to see if working tree has some junk other than
those listed in dontdiff, wouldn't this be sufficient?

  $ show-files --others | grep -f dontdiff

That's the whole point of git (and show-diff).  If it is not
listed in the cache, it does not exist.

Why do you need to "make clean"?  Is it because otherwise you
would get lots of output for things that are listed in dontdiff
but not listed in the cache, and the uncommitted but not listed
in dontdiff file that you care about would get lost in the
noise?

Earlier you complained show-diff does _not_ look at what are not
listed in the cache.  Now you want to exclude garbage that comes
out of it because you have tons of stuff that are not listed in
the cache, which implies show-diff _does_ look at what are not
listed in the cache.  Either you are contradicting yourself or I
am confused.

The truth is, as you said earlier, show-diff does not look at
them, so I do not understand what problem you are trying to
describe here.

Again, "checking for potentially uncommitted" files is what
you use show-files --others for, not show-diff.
