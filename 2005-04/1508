Hmm.. You should probably rename it to "git-reset-script" or something, 
and any time you reset the head, you should also amke sure to reset the 
index, because otherwise your index file may actually be referencing 
objects that no longer even exist, and that's going to be very very 
painful.

So

> +echo $head > .git/HEAD

should probably be followed by

	read-tree -m $head
	update-cache --refresh

which will also tell the user what files he has that are now "dirty" (and 
he can decide whether he wants to commit his changes, or whether he wants 
to do a "checkout-cache -f -a" to just get rid of it all).
