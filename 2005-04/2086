Because it would just have complicated the code and made it less flexible.

As it is, we can open an object by just knowing its name, and by "name" I 
mean the true one, the SHA1. No need for "open_blob()" or anything like 
that. You just do

	sha1_file_name(const unsigned char *sha1)

to find out what the filesystem name of the object is, and this works for 
_any_ object.

And thanks to this, we can pass in a sha1 _without_ knowing whether it's a 
tree or a commit (or a tag) and just open in. Then, when we figure out 
that it was a commit rather than a tree, we look up the tree instead. 

Being able to open files _without_ knowing what they are is hugely useful. 
The user passes you a name, and you can just do the right thing. 

Besides, I _still_ don't want scripts mucking around with the objects
directly. Remember? They're encrypted with my super-sekrit zlib encoder
ring, just because people shouldn't be mucking around in them.

Trust me, when the object directories have a million files, you'll thank
me. You do _not_ want to do a readdir and try to figure out tags that way. 
You want to do it the way I _force_ you to do it, ie the right way.
