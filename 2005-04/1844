You'd quite possibly use some shared secret key for some work. For 
example, say you're a company, and any "release person" can sign the 
work..

Also, since you can tag things without signing anything at all, it's even 
more trivial to get the same tag that way.

Signing tags really makes sense when you want somebody _else_ to trust it. 
But unsigned tags are perfectly practical from a _private_ perspective: 
let's say that you just want to remember certain events but you don't need 
to tell anybody else about them - what you'd do is to just create your own 
local tag, and there's no real reason to sign it, since you'll never tell 
anybody else about it anyway.

(One such thing could be to create a tag every time you compile and
install a new kernel: your "tag" is just a way to remember what your
installed kernel was built against, and is meaningless to anybody else.  
In fact, you might well decide to just remove such tags periodically).
