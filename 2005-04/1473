>>>Just have one 'git' script, which looks in /usr/local/libexec/git
> [or] /usr/libexec/git

The FHS <http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html> looks like it
recommends a /usr/lib/git directory:

  /usr/lib : Libraries for programming and packages

  Purpose
     /usr/lib includes object files, libraries, and internal binaries that
     are not intended to be executed directly by users or shell scripts.

     Applications may use a single subdirectory under /usr/lib. If an
     application uses a subdirectory, all architecture-dependent data
     exclusively used by the application must be placed within that  
     subdirectory.

My Debian sarge system has one libexec-like directory, but it follows
the FHS:

$ locate '/usr*libexec*'
/usr/lib/php4/libexec
