Tom, please stop this ext* filesystem bashing ;-) Even with filesystem
which compresses the tails of files into one filesystem block it
wouldn't make a difference that there are potentially (and very probably
even with blob numbers in order of 100000) 65536 directories on the
first level. This doesn't help much in fast reading the first level.

Even with milions of files this key structure doesn't make much sense -
the keys on the first and second levels are too long. However you're
right that the original structure proposed by Linus is too flat.
