With a UTC date, why would anyone care in which timezone the commit was
made?  Any pretty printing would most likely be prettiest if it is done
relative to the timezone of the person looking at the commit record, not
the person who created the record.

If we do need the timezone, then I think we also need the latitude of the
committer too, so that we know whether to interpret "July" as summer or
winter :-)
