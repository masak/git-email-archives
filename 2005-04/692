Dear diary, on Mon, Apr 18, 2005 at 11:53:57PM CEST, I got a letter
where Russell King <rmk@arm.linux.org.uk> told me that...

This does not need to touch git pull at all now; all the relevant logic
can change in git merge (and git commit), and I'm hacking that now. It
should be rather easy, I think.

I think I won't make git merge commit automatically - I think the user
should get a chance to do a git diff on what is getting merged to check
if everything is all right.

What is actually a little annoying is having to cd ,,merge and then
back, though. I don't know, but the current pull-merge script does not
bother with the temporary merge directory neither, even though Linus
wanted it. Linus, do you still do? ;-)
