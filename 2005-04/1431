Oh great, now we have variable length id strings too. And we'll have to
pretend the OS can store infinite length file names.

Er. So your so-unlikely-the-sun-will-burn-out-first scenario beats my
so-unlikely-the-sun-will-burn-out-first scenario? Why am I not worried?

Nooooo. Really?

Why not just use a 8192 bit hash for each 1KiB of data? We could store a
zero length file and store all the data in the filename. Guaranteed, no
hash collisions that way.

We make an assumption that we know is right most of the time, and we use
it because we know our computer will crash from random quantum
fluctuations before we have a chance of bumping into the problem. You do
know that metastability means that every logic gate in your computer
hardware is guaranteed to fail every "x" operations, where x is defined
by process size, voltage and temperature? Sure, any failures in git
would be data dependent rather than random, but that just means we don't
get to store carefully crafted blocks invented by hypothetical
cryptographers that have completely broken SHA.

You lose data either way. Just we get to burn out a few extra suns
before yours dies, and I can burn out whole galaxies before mine dies by
using a 256 bit hash, anyway.

Heh. I calculate it has a 50% probability of happening after you have
seen 10^24 input blocks. So, you are off by a factor of a trillion or
so.

Assuming we store 1 KiB blocks with a 160-bit hash, we would be able to
store 1000 Trillion Terabytes before the chance of hitting a collision
goes to 50%. To use marketing units, that is around 10 Trillion
Libraries of Congress. Every 2 bits we add to the hash doubles the
amount of data we can store before we hit a 50% probability of
collision.

I'm not sure how I could convince you that we're arguing about the
number of angels that could dance on a pin.

Ciao,
Ray
