They are totally stand-alone, and I don't see why that would be bad for 
shared object storage.

In fact, the whole point of them is that since they are named by the SHA1 
hash of the content, there are no shared object issues. Two different tags 
by two different developers will have different names, exactly the same 
way two different releases will have different names.

And if two different developers tag exactly the same object with exactly 
the same tag-name and exactly the same signature, then they get the same 
tag object, and that's fine. They should.

Tags in no way affect the entry they name. When you remove - or add - a
tag object, nothing happens to anything else.
