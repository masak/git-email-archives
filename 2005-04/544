Note that any given copy of a tree doesn't _need_ to keep all the
history back the beginning of time. It's OK if the oldest commit object
in your tree actually refers back to a parent which doesn't exist
locally. I can well imagine that some people will want to keep their
trees pruned to keep only a few weeks of history, while other copies of
the tree will keep everything.

However, if we _don't_ base our current work on an existing import of
the kernel, then we don't retain that option. We can't just change the
'parent' field of your 2.6.12-rc2 import, without changing the sha1 hash
of _everything_ that happens thereafter. 

So I'd say we should take Thomas' import, and base new work on that --
but then possibly leave out the older objects from the 'working'
repository which everyone is rsyncing from; just make them available in
a 'linux-history.git' object database elsewhere.
