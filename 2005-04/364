Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 17, 2005 at 01:27:43AM CEST, I got a letter
where Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com> told me that...

And racy. And not guaranteed to come up with fresh new files.

But I like this!

I'm deferring those changes to the introduction of a git shell library,
which several people volunteered to do so far, but noone sent me any
patches for (the last one was probably Martin Mares, only few hours ago
though).
