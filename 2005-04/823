Very true, you can't replace quilt with git without ruining both of them.  But 
it would be nice to take a quilt tree and turn it into a git tree for merging 
purposes, or to make use of whatever visualization tools might exist someday.

We already have a "trust me, it hasn't changed" via update-cache.  If it gets 
called wrong the tree won't reflect reality.  The patch doesn't change the 
write-tree default, but does enable you to give write-tree better information 
about the parts of the tree you want written back to git.

With that said, I hate the patch too.  I didn't see how to compare against the 
old tree without reading each tree object from the old tree, and that should 
be slower then what write-tree does now.  So I wimped out and made the quick 
patch that demonstrates the cause of the performance hit.

The "move .git/index to a tmpfs file" change should be easier though, and has 
a real benefit.  How do you feel about s|.git/index|.git/index_dir/index| in 
the sources?  This gives us the flexibility to link it wherever is needed.
