To me, it doesn't matter where the code came from.  It's necessary
but not sufficient that it seems to work.  It's necessary that it's
well understood and has undergone only well understood changes.

On that last necessity, a *lot* of open source projects are quite
pathetic.  `git'-style use of signatures raises the bar, slightly, for
where exploits can happen.  They also lower the bar for repudiation of
bogus changes.

Only if the audience is proactively skeptical.
