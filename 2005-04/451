that's not a problem. Most modules dont provide public symbols.  
Especially not drivers. Generally it's the modules that _dont_ have any 
global impact that get reviewed less stringently - an attacker would 
thus choose them for psychological reasons anyway.

it's not DB corruption, it's a feature of GIT: it's a content _cache_, 
new and old alike. Nothing in GIT says that old objects in the 
repository (which are still very much part of history) cannot be revived 
in newer trees. (in fact it regularly happens - e.g. if a fix is undone 
manually.)
