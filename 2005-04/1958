I don't really like having local branches and remote repositories be
treated the same. But I like each of them being available concepts
separately.

Ah, okay. I'm actually personally using a original repository called
"REPOSITORY" without a head or anything, with symlinks to that, so I don't
worry about accidentally killing the real thing from some branch. I've
really got a storage area per project, plus a set of links and tracking
stuff for each fork. I also back up the REPOSITORY on occasion,
particularly if I'm about to do something potentially destructive to the
database (like git-prune-script or convert-cache). I structure my
filesystem like:

  /working
    ... other projects
    /git
      /REPOSITORY (with only .git, non-symlink version)
      /linus
      /pasky
      /barkalow
      /cog-barkalow
      /diff
      ...

The part that I'm worried about is the way I turn a mass of debugging and
little local commits into a clean patch series. I've got a working fork
"barkalow", which is the result of a bunch of stuff and a dozen
commits. It is derived from "linus". I want to split up the changes and
make a series of commits, each of which will be a patch to submit.

1) I fork "linus" into "for-linus". I go into "for-linus".

2) I do "git diff this:barkalow > patch". This gives me the complete set
   of changes I want to submit.

3) I cut down the diff to a single logical change by removing all of the
   other hunks.

4) I do "git apply < patch". I do "git commit". I describe the logical
   change.

5) I go back to step 2, unless I'm done.

6) For each of the commits between "linus" and "for-linus", I do 
   "git patch <commit>", and send out the result.

The thing that I think requires the symlinks is step 2, which requires
that there be somewhere I can run git and have it able to see a pair of
unrelated local heads and the relevant trees.
