Yes, I was using a very recent version of the pasky tools,
I had created the repo this morning with git init YOUR_RSYC_URL_FOR_LINUX-2.6.
I did time git pull origin and watched the fur fly.

Then, the flurry of patching file blah messages, followed by a rather 
pregnant pause after the last patching message.

I wasn't complaining about the 4 minutes, just the lack of feedback
during the majority of that time.  And most of it was after the last
patching file message.

OK.  I may try some of this tomorrow from work, where I have a fat pipe.

I'm on dialup from home, and I suspect not very many folks want to hear
the sad tale of how long it takes to get the kernel over 56k dialup.
