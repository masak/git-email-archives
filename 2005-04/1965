I'm not too surprised; but can you hope to merge or compare PDFs
anyway? I'd think that you'd just screw up alignment or something. (Note
that we aren't using deltas for history storage, so we're not interested
in the "compressing multiple versions" aspect of diffs.) I think I want to
punt anything too binary-like and try to find an unambiguous history-based
difference (i.e., there was some commit in the past that replaced one of
the versions with the other; therefore, we want the replacing one).

I'm thinking of line-based compressed suffix trees, with the obvious delta
algorithm: make the trees, find the longest prefix of the file, find the
longest prefix of the rest of the file, add an insertion for a line
that doesn't match, repeat. I probably need a few extra things to
stabilize the process (prefer that the next chunk come from the same file,
prefer that it come from next in the file, ignore copied lines without
enough content).

I haven't actually started yet; I'm waiting for a weekend when I'm feeling
inspired and not too fried.
