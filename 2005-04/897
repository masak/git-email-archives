This part won't work. It needs to do the proper locking, which means that 
it needs to create "index.lock" _before_ it reads the index file, and 
write everything to that one and then do a rename.

If it doesn't need to do the write, it can just remove index.lock without 
writing to it, obviously.

To me, the biggest downside is actually the complexity part, and worrying
about the directory index ever getting stale. How big do the changes end
up being?
