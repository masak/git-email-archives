Actually, I just did it. Seems to work for the only test-case I tried,
namely I just committed it, and checked that the permissions all ended up
being recorded as 0644 in the tree (if it has the -x bit set, they get
recorded as 0755).

When checking out, we always check out with 0666 or 0777, and just let 
umask do its thing. We only test bit 0100 when checking for differences.

Maybe I missed some case, but this does indeed seem saner than the "try to 
restore all bits" case. If somebody sees any problems, please holler.

(Btw, you may or may not need to blow away your "index" file by just 
re-creating it with a "read-tree" after you've updated to this. I _tried_ 
to make sure that the compare just ignored the ce_mode bits, but the fact 
is, your index file may be "corrupt" in the sense that it has permission 
sets that sparse expects to never generate in an index file any more..)
