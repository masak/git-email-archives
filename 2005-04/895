This was much easier then I expected, and it seems to be working here.  It 
does slow down the write-tree slightly because we have to write out the index 
file, but I can get around that with the index file on tmpfs change.

The original write-tree needs .54 seconds to run

write-tree with the index speedup gets that down to .024s (same as my first 
patch) when nothing has changed.  When it has to rewrite the index file 
because something changed, it's .167s.

I'll finish off the patch once you ok the basics below.  My current code works 
like this:

1) read-tree will insert index entries for directories.  There is no index 
entry for the root.

2) update-cache removes index entries for all parents of the file you're 
updating.  So, if you update-cache fs/ext3/inode.c, I remove the index of fs 
and fs/ext3

3) If write-tree finds a directory in the index, it uses the sha1 in the cache 
entry and skips all files/dirs under that directory.

4) If write-tree detects a subdir with no directory in the index, it calls 
write_tree the same way it used to.  It then inserts a new cache object with 
the calculated sha1.

5) right before exiting, write-tree updates the index if it made any changes.

The downside to this setup is that I've got to change other index users to 
deal with directory entries that are there sometimes and missing other times.  
The nice part is that I don't have to "invalidate" the directory entry, if it 
is present, it is valid.
