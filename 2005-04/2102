I just read that paper and unless I am mistaken, it already describes
the basis for how GNU diff works.  I don't think anything in that
paper would make it faster.

I also don't find anything to suggest the Monotone guys have rewritten
diff.  Just some notes from graydon that notes python's difflib uses a
non-optimal diff that is faster in some cases.
