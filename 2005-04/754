I just stumbled across this page, dated 2003, which foreshadows a couple
of the decisions Linus has made for git:

  http://ydirson.free.fr/en/software/scm/vc.txt

Here are the parts that particularly caught my eye:

"what's so special about files ?" where the author suggests that
existing SCM systems are so blinded by the tradition of file orientation
that they can't see that there might be alternatives.

"As a goodie we can even note that moving a file inside the hierarchy
has become exactly similar as moving a code statement." where the author
recognizes that renames are merely a special case of code moves.

His implementation ideas are quite different from git, but I thought it
was pretty cool to find that someone was thinking about these ideas a
couple years ago.
