Having just done the git-0.7.tar.gz file with git-tar-tree, I started 
wondering if there is some nice way to encode the commit version that got 
tarred up into the tar archive itself.

There are various obvious ways, like creating a fake zero-sized file 
called <base>/.git-version-<commit-id>, and maybe that's the right thing 
to do. But maybe the tar archive format (and no, I don't even want to know 
details) has some nice way to hide off a keyname even _without_ having to 
create a file.

Would people like to have such a file for later? Obviously there would be 
a need to suppress it with a command line flag if you don't want it (or 
have a cmd line flag to enable it in the first place), what do people 
think? Rene?
