The problem is, how do you know how to define a token? That's also included
in a darcs patch.  And a darcs user may choose not to use a replace patch,
if (for example) he's renaming a local variable, since he might not want to
mess with other functions in the same file.

Guessing the author's intent cannot reliably reproduce the author's stated
intent.  Either we need to include that information in one form or another
(and in one location or another), or we've got to simply disallow replaces
(and moves?) when interacting with git.
