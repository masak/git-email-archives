Goodie.

Actually, you should put that down to horribly bad interface tools.  With
BK, we had these nice tools that pointed out that there were files that
you might want to commit (ie "bk citool"), and made this very obvious.

Tools absolutely matter. And it will take time for us to build up that 
kind of helper infrastructure. So being newbie might be part of it, but 
it's the smaller part, I say. Rough interfaces is a big issue.
