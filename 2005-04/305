Sure. We can export the 2.6.12-rc2 version of the git'ed history tree
and start from there. Then the first changeset has a parent, which just
lives in a different place. 
Thats the only difference to your repository, but it would change the
sha1 sums of all your changesets.

We have all the tracking information in SQL and we will post the data
base dump soon, so people interested in revision tracking can use this
as an information base.

:)

One remark on the tree blob storage format. 
The binary storage of the sha1sum of the refered object is a PITA for
scripting. 
Converting the ASCII -> binary for the sha1sum comparision should not
take much longer than the binary -> ASCII conversion for the file
reference. Can this be changed ?
