Whatever Linus' reasons, it's not a bad exercise and it does help
robustify the kernel project to roll its own.  Not that he seems to be
doing *this* part especially well or anything, but that doesn't matter
from the perspective of the good reasons to do it.

It doesn't matter much -- get stuff into git and people can layer on
that pretty gently.  The low layers of git are a common idea but
context and Linus' nifty code make this instance of the idea a bit
of a gem.

I'm surprised we haven't met sooner.  If we did and I forgot, sorry.
