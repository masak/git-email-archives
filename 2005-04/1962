One thing to keep in mind, about the way Linux development works (and
honestly, the way I think "git" development is currently working) is
that one of the things the version control system has to provide an easy
method to do is to abandon history that is messy.

For example, I'm adding a new driver, "foobar".

It uses the fancy quantum-bus, which is fairly new to the kernel.
The bus driver is new, and I go off, work in my private tree for a
month, fixing all kinds of quantum-entanglement related bugs, and
committing as I go.

I get everything working, and submit my driver.

The quantum-bus maintainer replies and says, "Hey, I reworked the API so
that you don't need to worry about all this quantum-entanglement stuff
anymore, just call compensate_for_heisenberg() before doing the DMA."

I swear for a day or two, and rework my driver, and resubmit it.

Now, all that history I had, with the duplicated imlementation, and
useless code is in my tree.

The current (as I understand it) policy is, "We don't want that
history."  This means that the developer will build a new tree (maybe),
export his patch and reimport it into a clean tree, making a much
simpler history graph.

What Andrew is doing isn't too far from this, in concept, it's just a
lot more complicated because he's pulling something insane, like 27
seperate trees, plus several hundred stand alone patches.

So, there's a *deliberate* desire to drop history and move some content
around outside of version control.

Now, the desire to pull a bunch of seperate trees, merge them, produce a
diff that roughly pertains to what came in from each tree, and collect
that as a patch series may be strange, but it seems to be working really
well at the moment, for Linux development.

Git (well, cogito, really) seems to be getting there awfully fast - I'm
rather impressed with the speed of it, and annoyed that I haven't had
the time to build up a test suite for merging!
