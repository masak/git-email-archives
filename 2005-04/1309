AFAICR Linus never used the word "subservient" to describe this
case [*R1*].  I do not know if the word is a good fit for
describing what it does.  Sorry, I cannot help you in deciding
if this is the right word nor in picking a better word.  I am
not a native speaker so I had to look it up in the dictionary.

That is what I wrote so I should say "sounds good", but after
re-reading it I realize we should describe how these trivial
ones are resolved, like so:

    Furthermore, "read-tree" has special-case logic that says: if you see
    a file that matches in all respects in the following states, it
    "collapses" back to "stage0":

     - stage 2 and 3 are the same;
       take one or the other (it does not make a difference)
     - stage 1 and stage 2 are the same and stage 3 is different;
       take stage 3
     - stage 1 and stage 3 are the same and stage 2 is different
       take stage 2

My comment was only about the '-t' option.  It is not one of the
options in the core.  Pasky may want to feed the change to
Linus.

    Ok, done. That was really the plan all along, it just got dropped in the 
    excitement of trying to get the dang thing to _work_ in the first place ;)

    ... I'll also make it do the same for a "single-tree merge":

            read-tree -m <newtree>

    so that you can basically say "read a new tree, and merge the stat 
    information from the current cache".  That means that if you do a
    "read-tree -m <newtree>" followed by a "checkout-cache -f -a", the 
    checkout-cache only checks out the stuff that really changed.
