"For the general case of people pruning their own trees, _maybe_ you're
right that it would be good to keep the commits even if we delete the
actual trees. But for history older than 2.6.12-rc2, that's a special
case -- I think we can happily delete the commits too.

"We can delete old trees/commits easily, but we can't _add_ them to the
existing linux-2.6.git tree, because the oldest commit in that tree
(b4ceb6e27e4cc3f37d26e04c4535c79b98a9f889) doesn't have a parent."
