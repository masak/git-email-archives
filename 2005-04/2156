And my point is that you haven't *begun* to describe how one might use an 
arbitrary hash collision to "crash a distributed blob-db infrastructure".

Remember, first you've got to get some reference to your collision into 
the db...  (and if you can do that, why are you mucking around with hash 
collisions?)
