The problem with this general scheme is that it means that you have to
start over if something goes wrong, rather than resuming from where you
left off (and being able to use what you got until then). I think a better
solution is to track what things you mean to have and what things you
expect you could get from where.

As for validation, I now have my programs (which I haven't gotten a chance
to send out recently) checking everything as it is downloaded to make sure
it is complete (zlib likes it) and has the correct hash.
