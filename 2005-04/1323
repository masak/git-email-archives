But if you download 1000 files of the 1010 you need, and then your network
goes down, you will need to download those 1000 again when it comes back,
because you can't save them unless you have the full history. 

There's also no way to say, give me just the head and the tree associated
with it, let me check it out, next download the commit history so I can do
my merge most correctly, let me do that, finally download the intermediate
blobs and trees so that I can track down where something broke.

Ideally, you'd be able to put the latest head and tree into your database,
and it would know that you just hadn't gotten the ancestor yet, and would
be able to determine from your personal metadata (rather than based on
what you had or lacked) that you believe you have all ancestors of the
previous time you pulled, you don't want the trees that Linus merged in
midway through, but everything else you just don't have yet.
