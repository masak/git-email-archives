I just committed some simple git status, which is equivalent to svn
status or cvs update (except it does no update). So it shows all the
files not tracked by git with a question mark in front of them.

This will need some ignore rules, though (currently it just ignores *.o
and the tags file). Now it turns out that it is rather unfortunate that
git ignores hidden files, since this would be a perfect object for that
- I think it is useful to have the ignore list tracked by git. I think I
will just name it git-ignores to be found in the working directory for
now.
