If you find an object with an unknown tag, you can't do much with it
anyway, even if it has a format that matches generic rules. Sure, you
could trace reachability through it, but that's only helpful for a couple
of generic programs (fsck and pull), and those programs ought to
additionally have some clue about what's going on if they're going to act
appropriately.

On the other hand, it is probably true that programs should be able to
deal abstractly with new tags if built with a libgit that supports them,
but that's something that we can arrange a bit later.
