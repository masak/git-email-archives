Your tag system is in the "cogito-0.8" release, plus a pasky-style way of
keeping track of what tags you have in your repository.

I think git pull only downloads the contents of the repo and saves the new
head in a separate file. You're left to do the merge yourself, in case
what you actually wanted to do was just read the patches in the remote
repo without merging them.

You probably need a "git merge git-net" here, and things will be in the
state that Linus expects.
