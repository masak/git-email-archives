Based on comments from Linus I did make it a little more merge aware.  But 
since my tool was just to tide me over until someone fixed things in gui 
form, I didn't want to kill off too many brain cells coding it.

and the git web stuff is pretty slick.  So it seems I didn't look hard enough 
before...
