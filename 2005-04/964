I don't think that's a good interface. It changes the sha1 passed into it: 
that may actually be nice, since you may want to know what it changed to, 
but I think you'd want to have that as an (optional) separate 
"sha1_result" parameter. 

Also, the "type" or "size" things make no sense to have as a parameter 
at all.

IOW, it was fine when it was an internal hacky thing in diff-cache, but 
once it's promoted to be a real library function it should definitely be 
cleaned up to have sane interfaces that make sense in general, and not 
just within the original context.
