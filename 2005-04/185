Be careful.  There is a very big tradeoff between 100% perfections in
catching these sorts of errors, and usability.  There exists SCM's
where you are not allowed to do commit such merges until you do a test
compile, or run a regression test suite (that being the only way to
catch these sorts of problems when we merge two branches like this).  

BitKeeper never caught this sort of thing, and we trusted it.  In
practice it was also rarely a problem.

I'll also note that BitKeeper doesn't restrict you from doing a
committing a changeset when you have modified files that have yet to
be checked in to the tree.  Same issue; you can accidentally check in
changesets that in trees that won't build, but if we added this kind
of SCM-by-straightjacket philosophy it would decrease our productivity
and people would simply not use such an SCM, thus negating its
effectiveness.
