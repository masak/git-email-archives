Dear diary, on Thu, Apr 21, 2005 at 02:43:33PM CEST, I got a letter
where Matthias Urlichs <smurf@smurf.noris.de> told me that...

While lack of locking is a problem for git-pasky too, for this git push
it is a downright disaster waiting to happen. It might be also a good
idea to check for remote 'blocked' file, which must exist and contain
only a "pushtree" line. This is so that no (sensible) real working tree
is attached to it, which would be a disaster for it too.

You probably don't want to allow pushing if your local tree is blocked.
And you want to allow pushing only when HEAD is your ancestor. (Helper
tool wanted for this - we need this in git merge badly too.)

BTW, it contains some unrelated and seemingly irrelevant tracking stuff.
