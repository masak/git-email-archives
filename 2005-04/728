I was looking at the tree part and am thinking that it would
make it much nicer if your tree object records path for each
entry.  Currently it just borrows from object.refs to represent
its children, which is good enough for the applications listed
above (none of them would care where in the tree the object
belongs to), but I was thinking about an incremental dumper I
talked about in another thread and noticed that I cannot use the
current struct tree as is to compare two trees to find related
sha1 files (then I would inflate both, run diff and record the
output as a recipe to create one sha1 object from the other).

Or am I misreading the code that parses tree objects?
