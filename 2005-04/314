I think we can make the git using stackable repository. When it fail
to find an object, it will try it's to read from parent repository.
It is useful to slice the history.

I can have local repository that all the new object create by me will
store in my tree instead of the official one. Clean up the object in the
my local tree will be much easier it only need to work on a much smaller
repository. If all my change is merge to official tree, I just simply
empty my local repository.

About the kernel git repository. I think it is much easier just put
them in one tree.  So I don't need to worry about "if I need to see
pre 2.6.12, I need to do this". And the full repository  need to
store in the server some where any way.

However I totally agree that people should not deal with unnecessary the history
when they start using the git tools. We should just make the tools
by default don't download all the histories. Only get it when user specific 
ask for it.

Why 2.6.12-rc2? When kernel grows to 2.6.15, a new user might not even need
pre 2.6.13 most of the time. If we make it very easier for people to get
history if they need, it will make them less motivate to store unnecessary
history locally (just in case I need it).

I think we should not advise using rsync to sync the whole git tree as
way to get update. We need to get use to only have a slice of the history
and get more if we needed.
The server should should provide some small metadata file like the
the rev-tool cache, so the SCM tools can download it to figure out what file
is needed to download to get to certain revision. Instead of download the
whole repository to figure out what is new.

We can even slice that metadata information to smaller pieces base on major release point.
