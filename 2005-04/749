Mixing declarations and code is the least of portability issues; it's in
the current C standard unlike a number of other things. I've personally
never found a system where -lz has deflateBound but gcc doesn't support
C99, although they obviously exist. I have no problem with fixing things
up for old GCC, although I'm going to have a hard time finding such things
because I can't find a way to make recent GCC reject C99 features but not
old GNU extensions.
