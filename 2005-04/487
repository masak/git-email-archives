Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 17, 2005 at 08:38:10AM CEST, I got a letter
where "David A. Wheeler" <dwheeler@dwheeler.com> told me that...

I personally don't mind getting it work on more places, if it doesn't
make git work (measurably) worse on modern Linux systems, the code will
not go to hell, you tell me what needs to be done and preferably give me
the patches. ;-)
