Let us assume that C and A were already in Linus' tree (and on our web
page) yesterday. Thus, they should be last. The newly-pulled stuff
should be first -- FEDBCA.

I'd say "depth-first, remote parent first" but that would actually show
show 'A' (as a parent of D) long before it shows C. Walking of remote
parents should stop as soon as we hit a commit which was accessible
through a more local parent, rather than as soon as we hit a commit
which we've already printed. Maybe it should be something like depth-
first, local parent first, but _reversed_?

The latter is what the mailing list feeder does, but that has the
advantage of being about to use 'rev-tree $today ^$yesterday' so we
_know_ we're excluding the ones people have already seen. Hence I
haven't really paid that much attention to getting the order strictly
correct.

(Yes, I know that strictly speaking, git has no concept of 'remote' or
'local' parents. But the ordering of the two parents in a Cogito merge
or pull hasn't changed, has it?)
