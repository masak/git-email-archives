Yes. Tell "diff-tree" what your desired files are, and it will cut down 
the amount of work by a _lot_ (because then diff-tree doesn't need to 
recurse into subdirectories that don't matter).

So you should just do

	for each changeset in rev-list
	do 
		diff-tree -r parent changeset <file-list>
	...

instead.

With more history, "rev-list" should do basically the right thing: it will
be constant-time for _recent_ commits, and it is linear time in how far
back you want to go. Which seems quite reasonable.

And diff-tree is obviously constant-time (and very fast at that, 
especially if you limit it to just a few files, since then it won't even 
bother with any other subdirectories).
