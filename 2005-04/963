A merkle-tree (which I think you initially pointed me at) makes the hash 
of the internal nodes be a hash of the chunk's hashes; ie not a straight 
content hash.  This is roughly what my current implementation does, but
I would like to identify each subtree with the hash of the 
*(expanded) contents of that subtree* (ie no explicit reference to 
subtree hashes).  This makes it interoperable with non-chunked or 
differently-chunked representations, in that the top-level hash is *just 
the hash of the complete content*, not some hash-of-subtree-hashes.  Does 
that make more sense?

The code I posted doesn't demonstrate this very well, but now that Linus 
has abandoned the 'hash of compressed content' stuff, my next code posting 
should show this more clearly.

Yes, I guess this is the detail I was going to abandon. =)

I viewed the fact that the top-level hash was dependent on the exact chunk 
makeup a 'misfeature', because it doesn't allow easy interoperability with 
existing non-chunked repos.
