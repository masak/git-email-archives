I personally don't think we're quite there yet. You'll note that a lot of 
routines just call "die()" when they don't find the data they want etc. 
All things that we probably will need to clean up eventually, but is fine 
for now.

Yes, we can start doing things like that, especially if they really _do_ 
end up making sense in a bigger picture.

Some of that is because I didn't clean up the Makefile until fairly
recently, so it used to be harder than it is now to have a shared object
file. In contrast, now you just add it to the list of library objects, and
off you go.

Sometimes specific duplication is just _easier_ than trying to be clever 
and having some generic shared version. For example, there's a few 
data-specific versions of "insert into sorted array" there, and the fact 
is, they are so simple that it's likely less work to keep them that way 
than it would be to create some "generic" thing that did it and was passed 
in some descriptor of the data. 

Generic routines aren't always good. Sometimes the abstraction ends up 
adding more of a mental burden than just doing the thing in a simple way 
in the first place.

They definitely are _not_ active in HEAD, at least not in my version.

You may have stale copies in your directory, but they should show up as
being stale when you do "show-files --others".
