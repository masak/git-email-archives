--cvs-direct was needed to speed it up from 'several days to finish' to 
'several hours to finish', but it crashed on a handful of patches [i 
used the latest devel snapshot so this isnt a complaint]. (one of the 
crashes was when generating 1860.patch.) Also, 'cvs rdiff' apparently 
emits an empty patch for diffs that remove a file that end without 
having a newline character - but this isnt cvsps's problem.  (grep for 
+++ in the patchset to find those cases.)

yeah, that's not that much of a problem, most of the names are unique, 
and the rest can be fixed up too.

i think it's included in BK.
