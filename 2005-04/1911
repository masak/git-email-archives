The git core is perfectly sufficient for getting all LCAs or
per-file best LCAs; merge-base doesn't bother, currently, because the
deficiencies of "merge" (a.k.a. diff3) are worse than the issues with
chosing a suboptimal LCA.

My plan is to implement multi-file diff and merge with a suffix tree-based
algorithm, and then revisit the history stuff once we have a merger that
can do sensible things with this information.

Note that the present very bad merger is actually seems to be sufficient
for the Linux kernel, where patches from different sides of a merge are
generally either unrelated or are identical, and, otherwise, they tend to
be true conflicts where people fixed the same bug independantly in
different ways.

I've been looking at Darcs (which seems to have a good method, although I
think the underlying diff isn't great), and Codeville still doesn't have
any documentation. Arch's method is strictly weaker than 3-way merge, and
generates more rejects (not even conflicts) in my experience than even
CVS.
