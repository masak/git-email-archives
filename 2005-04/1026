I suppose if you used the blob archive for storing many revisions the
number of stored blobs would be much higher. However even then we can
estimate that the maximum number of stored blobs will be in the order of
milions.

Yes, it really doesn't make much sense to have so big keys on the
directories. If we would assume that SHA1 is a really good hashing
function so the probability of any hash value is the same this would
allow storing 2^16 * 2^16 * 2^16 blobs with approximately same directory
usage.

The question is how many entries in directory is optimal compromise
between space and the speed of access to it's files.

If we suppose the maximum number of stored blobs in the order of milions
probably the optimal indexing would be 1 level [0:2] indexing or 2
levels [0:1] [2:3]. However it would be necessary to do some
benchmarking first before setting this to stone.
