I only did my version which spits out the comments at the top of the
shell script as a quick hack.

This looks good to me. Keeping the docs near the developer is essential,
I think.  Speaking of "I think", the name "cogito" was suggested for the
SCM layer, but IIRC Linus suggested staying with just plain git. Petr
suggested tig, perhaps because it looks at git from another point of view.

If we ever do decide to name the SCM layer (the git-pasky stuff) something
with "git inside", other choices are:

agitato		Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" 3rd movment is "Presto agitato"
legit		Since git is GPLv2, but perhaps a little too French.
regurgitate	No comment neccessary.
