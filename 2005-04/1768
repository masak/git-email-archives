No version control system will do a particularly good job of merging
content which got passed around outside of the system. They can be made to
sort-of handle some simple cases well, but fundamentally too much
information is getting dropped.

The solution is to get everyone using the same version control system,
which is actually quite a workable solution if (a) the version control
system in question is quite nice, and (b) there isn't some deep political
reason why many people will never agree to use it.
