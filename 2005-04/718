Well Russell has stated that he has to for EU Privacy reasons.  And I'd
like to do it as I don't have a local suse.de hostname for my laptop and
my employer probably doesn't really want my greg@dunce.kroah.org address
showing up :)

But if you really don't like it, and you don't want anyone trying to
hide anything, at least allow for a proper domainname.  On my boxes, the
domainname doesn't show up at all without that patch (just the
getdomainname() part).  I'll split it out if you want.

thanks,

greg k-h
