Indeed, register was ALWAYS a non-binding hint. Today,
unless you have specific measurements showing that adding "register"
at some point improves the performance for a (somewhat common) situation,
you're better off NOT including "register" nowadays.  Today's compilers
are generally better at allocating registers than 
people-who-have-little-time.
Premature optimization is the root of all kinds of evil...

It's not, strictly speaking, okay on old pre-C99 compilers.
But in practice, practically all C compilers from the last 10+ years
have accepted // comments as a very popular extension.
So using "//" is unlikely to be a portability problem, even on semi-old 
compilers.
