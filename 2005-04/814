Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 19, 2005 at 04:41:34PM CEST, I got a letter
where David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> told me that...

I'd stay with the top comment for now, and go for perldoc in the Perl
scripts. It's cool, nice, and you can export it to anything and it still
looks mostly cute.

I'm all for slow migration from sh to Perl so that we can add more cream
on the stuff. Shell was great for the first phase of rapid development
(where basically the most important thing was to be able to call the
core git easily, and just wrap it around) but now if you want to do the
fancier stuff (like git status, or even git log), it's getting more of a
nuisance.
