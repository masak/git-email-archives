The current merge-base finds the common ancestor with the most recent
date. The old algorithm was giving some surprising results, where it
didn't always take advantage of a straight line from one side to the
other. At some point, I'm going to try to have it find the ancestor with
the shortest shorter path, which I think should work best of all.

In any case, I think your documentation should just say it finds as good a
common ancestor as possible, since that's what it's really for, regardless
of the details of how it decides. Also, it shouldn't be depended on to
decide in any particular way.
