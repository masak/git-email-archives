I agree, it's brittle by design, exactly because I think it's very 
important not to allow any variations.

HOWEVER, that's where "convert-cache" comes in. Any one particular format 
may be brittle, but if we accept that, and just say "we can upgrade by 
converting the cache", then we should be ok. IOW, we can change from one 
brittle format with 160-bit SHA1 names to _another_ brittle format with 
256-bit SHA1 (or other) names.

Now, I kind of agree with that, but not on a "object level".

But exactly because the object level is "brittle by design", and because I 
the way to fix that is convert-cache (which may do _big_ changes to the 
format), I really don't think that the objects should ever be looked at 
except with very precise tools.

But when it comes to "higher-level information", I agree with you 100%.

For example, this _is_ actually why I wanted pasky to change the format of 
"git log" (now cg-log). Exactly so that the output of that isn't brittle, 
it now prepends spaces to the free-form part.
