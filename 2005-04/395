looks my 1878 line patch to convert git to libgit got eaten by vger..
I put it up at http://pbx.picketwyre.com/~mtaht/libgit.patch if anyone 
wants to comment. from my log:

Converted git to libgit. Moved all the main() calls into a single 
multi-call binary - git-main.
Made extern a bunch of functions that were static. Verified it at least 
still minimally worked.
Note: this is only a first step towards creating a generic library. 
Figuring out what functions and variables *truly* need to be exported, 
renaming them to a git_<function> api, making it thread safe
... and not least of all, keeping up with everybody working out of the 
base tree... are problems that remain. Also - cleaning up the UI.
