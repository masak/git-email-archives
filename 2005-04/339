How about building a file list and doing a batch download via 'wget -i 
/tmp/foo'? A quick test (on my ancient wget-1.7) indicates that it reuses 
connectionss when successive URLs point to the same server.

Writing yet another http client does seem a bit pointless, what with wget 
and curl available. The real win lies in creating the smarts to get the 
minimum number of files.
