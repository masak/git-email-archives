Hi, Matthias!

This functionality is badly needed, but "git cancel" should probably
remain what it is.

Considering that the patch is essentially just this block of code, it
could be (in the first approximation) a separate command, e.g. "git
switch", that would call "git cancel" if needed.

But let's consider the fact that "git cancel" removes all local changes.
That's quite a serious side effect.  I don't always want to remove local
changes when I switch between branches in CVS.  Many users would prefer
git to do a merge.

I think that "git track" needs to be redesigned.  There are at least
three properties of the working directory (related to branch tracking)
that users may want to change:

1) Where new revisions are pulled from.  It could be more than one
branch (ideal implementation - with several copies of rsync run
simultaneously).

2) What branch is "checked out" to the working directory, i.e. what
branch would "git cancel" restore.

3) Whether new changes are merged automatically.

I suggest following syntax:

git track -b WORKING-BRANCH [--cancel] [--active|--passive]
[TRACK-BRANCH...|--notrack]

--cancel would cancel changes rather than merge when the current branch
changes.

--active enables automerge, --passive disables it

Empty list of branches to track should not disable tracking.  Only
--notrack should do it.

Then your "git cancel BRANCH" would become:
git track -b BRANCH --cancel
