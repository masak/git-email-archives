I also see this as one of the biggest obstacles right now. It would be
very helpful if we could achieve the clear separation between git and
non-git that has been part of the design since the beginning.

Git is very immature, and currently should only be used by brave
pioneers. About the only way for a mortal to even try git is to stick to
git-pasky releases, and not try to track all the patches flying around.

The best description I have seen so far is the README for git-pasky:
  http://pasky.or.cz/~pasky/dev/git/

It's not a bad mini-tutorial, really.

As you know, documentation is a great way for non-coders to contribute
to a project. Until someone steps up to write it, it won't happen.

In a highly iterative development process like this one, it actually
doesn't make sense to write the docs first. You really don't know how it
should work until you code it, play with it, and then realize it should
be doing something different.

I think the main goal was rapid implementation. I totally expect there
to be one or several wrappers, written in various languages, that will
eventually replace git-pasky.

I agree that it would be nice to have automated unit tests.

The code is still young, and these will be fixed. I'm not bothered that
there are leaks at this moment. I am a bit bothered by Linus's attitude
that some small leaks might not ever need to be fixed.
