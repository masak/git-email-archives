Ehrm, maybe I'm way off. =)

Ok.

Well, maybe I misunderstood everything, but I thought you were
applying a lot of patches and complained that it took a lot of time
due to the data order.

When I applied a lot of patches to the kernel recently the cpu load
dropped to zero after a while and the HD worked hard a sec or two and
then things came back again. My primitive guess is that it was because
the ext3 journal became full. To workaround this fact I started
hacking on this in-memory patcher.

In the cycle above, I'm trying to speed up step 1:
If the patch modifies each source file multiple times (either using
multiple hunks or multiple ---/+++) then the lines below the hunk in
the source file will be moved multiple times. And if the source file
is written to disk after each hunk or ---/+++ is applied then this
will generate a lot of writes that can be avoided if the entire patch
procedure is broken down into a first pass that analyzes the patches
and a second pass that applies the patches and keeps source files in
memory.

But my rather trivial observation above is of course only suitable if
you have a lot of patches that should be applied and you are only
interested in the final version of the patched source files. If you
apply one patch at a time and import each source file as a new
revision then my little hack is probably not for you.
