Dear diary, on Fri, Apr 22, 2005 at 04:31:43PM CEST, I got a letter
where Martin Schlemmer <azarah@nosferatu.za.org> told me that...

yes; that was actually the plan, it's just that my memory is so
volatile...

Does it actually make sense to keep a tarball with history? Just build
git-pasky and do git init. (Or rsync it manually.)
