Not quite; you are saving 20 registers, so you need a 96-byte stack
frame, like this:

	stwu	%r1,-96(%r1)
	stmw	%r13,16(%r1)
	...
	lmw	%r13,16(%r1)
	addi	%r1,%r1,96
	blr

Since sha1_core is a leaf function, I suppose you could use the lr
save area (do stwu %r1,-80(%r1); stmw %r13,0(%r1)) but it seems a bit
dodgy.

Yes.

I did 10 repetitions of my program that calls SHA1_Update with a
4096-byte block of zeroes 256,000 times.  With my version, the average
time was 4.6191 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.0157.  With your
version, the average was 4.6063 and the standard deviation 0.0148.  So
I would say that your version is probably just a little faster - of the
order of 0.3% faster.
