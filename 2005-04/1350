Could the problem be related to some random garbage left in .git/add-queue
and .git/rm-queue?

If so, how did these files get generated in the first place, and why
weren't they removed when they were finished with?

IMHO updating a repository from an external source should _NOT_ be
affected by the presence (or absense) of these two files, which
contain only _local_ state information.
