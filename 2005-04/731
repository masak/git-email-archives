Okay, either I'm a sight stupider than I thought, or I'm not
communicating well. Same net effect either way, I 'spose.

If I do a token replace in an editor (say one of those fancy new-fangled
refactoring thangs, or good ol' vi), a token-level comparator can
discover what I did. That link I sent is an example of one such beast.

Who said anything about guessing? If a user replaces all instances of
foo with bar, that's as close to proof as you can ever get, without
recording intent of the user at the time it's done. Now, I realize that
darcs *does* record intent, but I claim that's immaterial.

Perhaps I'm clueless; it's happened before, I'm resigned to it happening
again. So, tell it to me with full jargon, if you will. When it comes
down to brass tacks, why does my suggestion place weaker guarantees
about the quality of the resulting patch operator?

Agreed. But then you go lart the committer of that patch.

Eh? Why? "darcs mv" *is* a commit. Just because it doesn't seem to look
like one doesn't change the fact that you just invoked the SCM.

And that's harder, I agree. But unless I'm missing some nifty
refactoring editor out there that integrates with darcs during the edit
session, the user *still* has to tell the SCM about the rename manually.

It'd be unfortunate if git were limited to such a small developer base.

I'm not claiming you are. We want the same thing -- a nuanced SCM that
can take some of the drudge-work away from this stuff.
