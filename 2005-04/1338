If # of execs is that critical, it probably should not be in
bash anyway.  OpenBSD (at least 3.1)'s bash appears to be in
/usr/local/bin/bash, NOT /bin/bash.
I'd go with the /bin/env solution for now;
it maximizes the "it just works" factor, and
when it comes time for .in files much of the cogito code (at least)
will probably be rewritten in Perl, and anything performance-sensitive
will be in C.
