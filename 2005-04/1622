I fixed this bug and another nasty one in "bit pull". The new version is 
up in its usual place:

bit clone http://nil.ics.uci.edu/~gal/public/bit

(You can't use pull because it was broken in the previous version.)

Another unrelated note: to add files to your repository, do "bit commit 
filename". To remove a file, delete it and then do "bit commit 
deleted-filename" (yes, I will add "bit add" and "bit rm" at some point).
