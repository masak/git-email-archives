Yes. "cg-update branch-name" is EXACTLY the same as
  cg-pull branch-name && cg-merge branch-name
You can see this by examining the last lines of the cg-update script.
Because updating is one of the single most common operations for an SCM,
it makes sense to have a single command that does it.

Currently cg-update without a branch name does "recover deleted files"
instead, but I think that's a wart & Petr agrees (that will probably
get moved to a different command, see separate discussion).

Correct; cg-merge calls "cg-commit -C" (ignore cache)
if the merge is clean.

Correct.

I can't speak Petr, but I would guess that he's doing that because
he's trying to avoid data loss.

cg-pull BRANCH copies any changes from the named branch into your
repository.  You could do a diff afterwards, yes, to get the
same results as long as the data is in your repository.  However,
after a successful merge the HEAD will be different from before
a successful merge, so the DEFAULT answers from a
diff will be different.

You'll have to ask Petr.  My guess is that he has bigger plans
for cg-clone, what you're seeing is just the current stub.

Anyway, hope my guessing helps.
