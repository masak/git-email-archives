This is not a fix, this is a band-aid. A fix is fitting all the data
in 10 times less space without sacrificing too much performance.

But its sibling bandwidth _is_ a problem. The delta between 2.6.10 and
2.6.11 in git terms will be much larger than a _full kernel tarball_.
Simply checking in patch-2.6.11 on top of 2.6.10 as a single changeset
takes 41M. Break that into a thousand overlapping deltas (ie the way
it is actually done) and it will be much larger.
