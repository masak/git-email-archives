You never free this buffer.

It would also be nice if you saved "tree" objects in some temporary file
and did not install them until after you had fetched all the blobs and
trees that this tree references.  Then if your connection is interrupted
you can just restart it.

Otherwise this looks really nice.  I was going to script something
similar using "wget" ... but that would have made zillions of seperate
connections.  Not so kind to the server.
