Alright.  Please consider the patch retracted.

Hmph.  Timestamps do not mean anything in most of the intended
use of diff-* family, since they are meant to operate on trees,
except:

 - comparing against the working tree --- show-diff's <new> and
   diff-cache's <new>; we can take the timestamp from the
   filesystem.

 - comparing against a tree that comes from a known commit ---
   we can take the timestamp of the commit that contains the
   file.

If we want to show the timestamp of the latter, diff-tree and
diff-cache need to be taught to take notice if their
tree-or-commit parameter is actually a commit and if so needs to
pass the timestamp in the committer field down the path for the
diff driver.  There is no way for diff-tree-helper to do this
because the origin information is already stripped out when it
sees a valid SHA1.

So I'd say we'd punt this one for now, unless somebody else has
a better idea.
