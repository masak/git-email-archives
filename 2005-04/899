Eh, let's not talk using integral/summation view across all the patches
that ever could have come in against the file. We're hamstringing
ourselves if we do that, and it's not what darcs does. darcs looks at a
differential view of the changes, and for a mv, it looks at it when it
happens.

darcs does a "darcs mv" to commit a "file move patch" to whatever
logging or patch repository it keeps below the surface.

The equivalent in git would be to have a given tree, move a file via
bash's mv, and then checkpoint a new tree. (I'm sure there's details in
there, but that's plumbing, and what we have Petr for.)

A differential comparison of the two trees shows no content changed, but
a file label was modified. Ergo, a rename occurred.

QED.
