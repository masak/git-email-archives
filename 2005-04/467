Yes.

In fact, one of my hopes was that other SCM's could just use the git
plumbing. But then I'd really suggest that you use "git" itself, not any
"libgit". Ie you take _all_ the plumbing as real programs, and instead of
trying to link against individual routines, you'd _script_ it.

In other words, "git" would be an independent cache of the real SCM,
and/or the "old history" (ie an SCM that uses git could decide that the
git stuff is fine for archival, and really use git as the base: and then
the SCM could entirely concentrate on _only_ the "interesting" parts, ie
the actual merging etc).

That was really what I always personally saw "git" as, just the plumbing
beneath the surface. For example, something like arch, which is based on
"patches and tar-balls" (I think darcs is similar in that respect), could
use git as a _hell_ of a better "history of tar-balls".

The thing is, unless you take the git object database approach, using 
_just_ the index part doesn't really mean all that much. Sure, you could 
just keep the "current objects" in the object database, but quite 
frankly, there would probably not be a whole lot of point to that. You'd 
waste so much time pruning and synchronizing with your "real" database 
that I suspect you'd be better off not using it.

(Or you could prune nightly or something, I guess).
