I don't understand this paragraph. What is an internal
hash function? Your code seems to do exactly what I want.
The hashes are computed recusively as in a hash tree
with O(N ln N). The only difference between your design
and a design based on a conventional (binary) hash tree
seems to be that data is stored in the intermediate nodes
too.=20

If I don't miss anything essential, you can validate
each treap piece at the moment you get it from the
network with its SHA1 hash and then proceed with
downloading the prefix and suffix tree (in parallel
if you have more than one peer a la bittorrent).

You might be right. I just wanted to point out this
possibility because it would allow to avoid calling
external merging code for a lot of trivial merges.
