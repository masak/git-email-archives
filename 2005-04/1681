No, if it's a merge, you just suck in all the already-compressed objects.  

You never compress anything new - you get the objects, you update your
tree index, and you're done. No overhead anywhere - a clean merge may
_look_ like it's changing thousands of files, but it didn't change a
single _object_ anywhere, it just re-arranged the objects and created a
new view of them.

Most merges are literally just a tree-level thing. Sometimes you have to 
do a content merge, but that tends to be a file or two.
