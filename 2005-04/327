I'm actually working on a trivial HTTP client to do this. The user says
"get <commit-id> from <url>", and it gets that object, the associated
trees, and the associated blobs, skipping any that it already has.

This should save having a non-standard public-facing server process, and
be essentially as effective, at least once I have it using a single
connection for everything.
