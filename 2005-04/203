I actually considered that. I ended up not doing it, because it's not 
obvious how to "block" things up (and even more so because while I like 
the notion, it flies in the face of the other issues I had: performance 
and simplicity).

The problem with chunking is:
 - it complicates a lot of the routines. Things like "is this file 
   unchanged" suddenly become "is this file still the same set of chunks",
   which is just a _lot_ more code and a lot more likely to have bugs.
 - you have to find a blocking factor. I thought of just going it fixed 
   chunks, and that just doesn't help at all. 
 - we already have wasted space due to the low-level filesystem (as 
   opposed to "git") usually being block-based, which means that space 
   utilization for small objects tends to suck. So you really want to 
   prefer objects that are several kB (compressed), and a small block just
   wastes tons of space.
 - there _is_ a natural blocking factor already. That's what a file 
   boundary really is within the project, and finding any other is really 
   quite hard.

So I'm personally 100% sure that it's not worth it. But I'm not opposed to
the _concept_: it makes total sense in the "filesystem" view, and is 100%
equivalent to having an inode with pointers to blocks. I just don't think 
the concept plays out well in reality.
