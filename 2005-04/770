I see it as a matter of correctness since in a given BKCVS changeset
(i.e. revision in the ChangeSet,v file) you may miss files. You would
eventually get them, with the same log, but in a different patch. If
you don't care about this, you can call it 'perfection'.

At that time I thought about modifying cvsps to use the "(Logical
change ...)" string instead of time/date for grouping the files but I
realised it is easier with a shell script.

There was no reply to this e-mail. It might have been fixed in the
meantime but I don't think the history was fixed as well.
