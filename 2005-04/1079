Dear diary, on Thu, Apr 21, 2005 at 03:42:39AM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...

Hello,

you can't. There was 'git update' (and intermediate never-committed 'git
switch'), but I decided not to support it for now, since I don't have
any compelling usage case for it. Do

	git fork my-linus ~/my-linus linus

and you will get a local clone of Linus' branch in ~/my-linus, tracking
and everything.

Since git merge's purpose is to _merge_, not _switch_, so it picks the
common ancestor by default; another disadvantage is that this happens on
top of your local tree, but your history will record it as a merge which
shares both linus and my history, which isn't quite right. What is
peculiar, though, is that it didn't remove the files specific to
git-pasky.
