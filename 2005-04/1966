I've been doing just this. I actually import it in pieces, with a commit
between each, so it's just like I applied the patch series I'm about to
send out. It actually works beautifully, and, someday, I'll have the
series up on my site so that a maintainer can just pull it.

Honestly, I'm not interested long-term in my buggy history, even
locally; I'm interested in the clean history in which I make a series of
self-contained, logical modifications and they get merged upstream.

I think it's more a desire to drop history as it actually happened, and
replace it with history as it should have happened. The one thing I would
like is the ability to provide merging help to poor souls who got part of
the messy history without preserving that history. I think having the head
of the clean series have a bunch of lines: "replaces <sha1>", where people
aren't supposed to have or want that commit, but if they've merged it,
they should know that the clean series includes its content.
