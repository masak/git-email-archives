Actually, you really want to have a bidirectional interaction, where the
client first fetches the info to determine where to start, and then goes
through the reachable space, asking for anything it doesn't already have.

(In the long run, we want to keep track of some things we already have all
of, or know we're missing, etc., so the receiver side doesn't have to
look over its whole tree.)

git already includes two versions of this protocol; the first runs against
a static HTTP server, and the second uses ssh to get a socket. At some
point, I'm going to enable these programs to read and write
.git/refs/?/? to figure out what they're supposed to get.
