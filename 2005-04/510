(I added a merge line so there's another commit to discuss in the picture)

I think you're going to want multiple common ancestors being used in the
merge when this thing starts to happen; otherwise, you're going to have to
fix up conflicts for "patch" for all the trees you pull. (Also, you're
only going to see a parent for patch (that is, the old revision as an
ancestor of the application of patch) if the trees are merging it in via
git, in which case you'll also see a commit for patch, which will have a
recent date. So you'd see "just yesterday, we both merged a tiny 
change; so that tree, which is very much like an ancient one, is more
recent that last weeks major merge".

I dunno either, but I hope we'll have 2+n-way-merge before there's a lot
of complex history to deal with.
