GNU diff is based on a better algorithm than traditional diff, reportly,
but there are better algorithms still, developed since, at least according
to a brief literature search on Google Scholar. (bdiff and vdelta, for
example, which can identify block moves as well.)

I suspect that the speed is suboptimal (for the cases under which it is
actually used). The quality of the output is about ideal, lacking a
representation for block moves, but I'm hoping to have a diff/merge set
that handles block moves effectively, even if it can't report them in diff
format. I'm also hoping for an annotate function that could use block
moves.

I would think that darcs would be able to do neat things in its merger if
it knew about block moves. Obviously, it only makes sense to add support
for identifying them and using them at the same time.
