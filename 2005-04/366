Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 17, 2005 at 01:28:04AM CEST, I got a letter
where Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com> told me that...
> Reduce number of subcommands execv'd by a

> loop.

The idea behind that was that diffing could take a significant portion
of disk space, especially when making large kernel diffs. Perhaps we
could make this a switch, but I would personally prefer defaulting to
the less space-consuming behaviour. I personally dislike applications
which like to pop 150M of nonsense to my /tmp.

Please don't reindent the scripts. It violates the current coding style
and the patch is unreviewable.
