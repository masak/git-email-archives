Agreed, hence why I did it as a package-build-time patch instead of changing 
directly in my repository.

How standard is this '/usr/libexec'? I have no such directory on my Debian 
boxes. If /usr/share rubs you the wroung way, what of 
simply /usr/lib/git-pasky?

Definately, and it may not play well with the simpler method of installing to 
$HOME/bin. This was just a quick hack as not to pollute /usr/bin with files 
that aren't directly executed by the user.

This will all be moot when cogito goes the way of cg-* ;-)
