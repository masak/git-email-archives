Actually, the documentation I've got says:

"F_OK requests checking whether merely testing for the existence of the
 file would be allowed (this depends on the permissions of the directories
 in the path to the file, as given in path-name.)"

So it shouldn't complain about a filename which you're allowed to try to
stat, even if there's nothing there. And it would depend on the privs of
the wrong user in looking at the path.
