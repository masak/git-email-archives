   I'd have agreed with you (and I did, violently) if it wasn't for the
   performance issues. It makes a huge difference for write-tree, and to me,
   clearly performance _does_ matter.

   Fractions of seconds may not sound like a lot, but they add up. I work 
   with 200-patch series myself all the time, so I'm very sensitive to a 0.3 
   second difference in performance.


How many times per day do you invoke `write-tree' and why?

It takes a large multiple of `0.3s' to get me to take you seriously
on this point.

I have long harbored the suspician that your perceived bandwidth
implies that you process a lot of patches unread or barely read --
implying that your day-to-day bitslingling could/should largely be
handled by an Arch-style patch-queue-manager (a script).
