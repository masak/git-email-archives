Since it does not really checkout. Ok, it does, but that's only small
part of it. It just cancels whatever local changes are you doing in the
tree and bring it to consistent state. When you have a merge in progress
and after you see the sheer number of conflicts you decide to get your
hands off, you type just git cancel. Doing basically anything with your
tree (not only local changes checkout would fix, but also various git
operations, including git add/rm and git seek) can be easily fixed by
git cancel.

Already fixed. (Well, "fixed"... sent to /dev/null. ;-)
