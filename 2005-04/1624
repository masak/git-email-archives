Are tag objects referenced by trees (and thus limited in scope) or are 
they stand-alone entities in the repository? The latter would be bad for 
shared object storages. Also, if I delete and recreate tags, will the old 
tag remain in the tree or will the file in the object storage disapear? 
So far all objects were always persistent, which is a nice property to 
have.
