Actually, we should decide on what diff-tree-helper does before that. 
Right now it always either calls out to the external diff program, or it 
says "cannot parse".

It's possible that an external "diff" program might actually want to know
about unmerged files (maybe people don't actually do "diff", but something
else altogether), so one approach might be to just make that an option.

The other approach is to just have something like "<pathname> is unmerged"
as output from diff-tree-helper. That isn't quite as flexible, but it sure 
is simpler..
