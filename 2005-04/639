Hell no.

The commit _does_ specify the patch uniquely and exactly, so I really 
don't see the point. You can always get the patch by just doing a

	git diff $parent_tree $thistree

so putting the patch in the comment is not an option.

Then you can use the patch to index to whatever extra "darcs index" 
information you want to.

That's definitely the case. I will _not_ be taking random files etc just 
to keep other peoples stuff straightened up.

If you want to add a "log ID", you can certainly do that, but the data the 
ID refers to is _you_ data, and will not go into the git archive. So:

No, git will not track commit-specific files. There's the comment section,
and that _is_ the commit-specific file. But I will refuse to take any
comments that aren't just human-readable explanations, together with maybe 
one extra line of

	# Darcs ID: 780c057447d4feef015a905aaf6c87db894ff58c

(others will want to track _their_ PR numbers etc) and that's it. The 
actual darcs data that that ID refers to can obviously be maintained in 
_another_ git archive, but it's not one I'm going to carry about.
