AFAIK the paper mentioned in the GNU diff sources [1] is an improvement
to an earlier paper by the same author titled
"A File Comparison Program" - Miller, Myers - 1985.

Can you be more specific why the algorithm is a bad choice (performance,
quality of diff output)?

Ok, darcs doesn't handle block moves, so there is no need for an algorithm that
supports them (yet). Is there any free SCM that has support for block moves at
the moment? It seems like clearcase detects them, but I don't know where it
takes advantage of it.
