Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 17, 2005 at 08:18:47PM CEST, I got a letter

Someone started the avalanche by adding date to the structure. Of
course, date is smaller, but it leads people (including me) out of the
way.

Perhaps struct commit which will have struct revision (ugh - what about
rather struct object?) as a member?

That's some really bad naming then.

The goal was to have a commit record parser which would spit out this
structure containing all the relevant info, but I can agree that wasting
memory with it makes no sense. Perhaps it could take a possibly-NULL
buffer pointer where it would drop the tree ID, Daniel?
