Yours reads the whole commit history; I intentionally wrote mine to
only read as far back as turns out to be necessary. I think that looking
at the whole history is going to be impractical when you're trying to
merge in a bunch of patches against the latest release, even if you pull
the history out of a cache. When it's one step on one side and a dozen on
the other, it matters a whole lot if there's a year of history behind the
common ancestor(s).

So I still think it's best to have a non-recursive commit parser, and do
the recursion only as needed for the operation under consideration.
