This won't actually work for merge-base, which wants to run two of these,
one for each head, in parallel, and find the first commit on both lists. I
think making insert_by_date() ignore items already in the list is a better
solution, although that might run into problems if there's a complicated
graph of commits all with the same time.

Another option is to specify a object.flags bit to mark for each commit
and ignore commits that are already marked.
