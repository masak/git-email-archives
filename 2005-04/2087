Actually, I like having the full mode bits in there.
"git" actually can be useful as a more general capability for
keeping careful track of an entire tree that's NOT just source code
(e.g., your entire home directory tree, so you can replicate it
across machines in its current state).

I can easily imagine an option flag
that stores "modes as they really are", and another that says
"use the modes as they are stored".  Add some support for symlinks,
and you could do quite a bit. Timestamps would be ducky,
too, for the same reason.
