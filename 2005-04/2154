So far, this is a frustrating conversation to watch. Here's my own
interpretation, presented to help the participants understand whether or
not their intended messages are getting through clearly.

Originally, Tom seemed to claim that the problem was that git requires
you to sign an entire tree, rather than a diff, even though the signer
is only vouching for their diff.

Linus responded by saying that a git signature of a tree would match
that description, but signing a commit is different. I think he claimed
that (by convention) signing a commit ONLY means you are signing the
most recent change, which turned tree A into tree B.

Tom then appeared to propose some specific attacks that could work
against the git model. The precondition seems to be if the patch
receiver does not exhaustively analyze each and every patch. The
receiver trusts the contents based solely on who signed the commit object.

One category of attacks were that a computer or communication channel
was broken. It's not immediately clear to me how git's model contributes
any weakness to these cases, compared to other signing strategies.

The other category of attack mentioned was social, such as a signer
creating a patch that claims to do one thing, but actually does another.
Again, I don't see how git is weaker in this case than any other tool.

Noel then pointed out that in practice, someone receiving a signed
commit in git would view the commit comments and the diff, so the effect
is similar to having the diff itself be signed.

And that's where we are right now. So, from here, it looks like Tom
needs to be more specific about which attacks might be more effective
against git's signing strategy than against signed diffs.
