This goes back to the question of whether to rename git-pasky to cogito.  

Perhaps the crucial question is:  will the git plumbing be used for anything
other than SCM?

If so, then it could be useful to differentiate by program name, so that we
would know whether another project was utilizing git-plumbing or git-SCM.

If not, then there is effectively only one tool and the plumbing is a
[crucial] portion thereof:  a git (SCM and the file system around which it
was built).

So what's the answer to the question?  Anyone planning to use git (the file
system) outside of the SCM?
