note that default configs of ext2 and ext3 don't qualify as sane 
filesystems by this definition.

ext3 does have an extention that you can enable to have it hash the 
directory access, but even if you enable that on a filesystem you aren't 
guaranteed that it will be active (if the directory existed before it was 
turned on, or has been accessed by a kernel that didn't understand the 
extention then the htree functionality won't be used until you manually 
tell the system to generate the tree)
