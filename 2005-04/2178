Unless I have completely misunderstood things, you never need to compare 
the file contents.  Just compare the file names.  If they match, i.e. the 
SHA1 is the same, the contents must match by definition.  So you only need 
a stat(), rather than read&decompress&compare.

There should definitely be an option to either enable or disable this as 
there are legitimate cases for not wanting hard links or indeed using 
file systems which do not support them.
