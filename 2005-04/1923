Dear diary, on Thu, Apr 28, 2005 at 02:19:07AM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

Oops, you are of course right. This was a stupid leftover from the
pre-diff-cache days, and since then I never looked at this code from
sufficient distance to see it. ;-)

Actually, I can't; the patch generator is not on par with mine yet.
It does not show modes and does not indicate file adds/removals by
/dev/null - basically, I need something cg-patch can eat (and it should
be backwards compatible). I think throwing the sha1 hashes away will not
harm; I got used to the Index: field and === marker, but I don't care if
I loose it.
