Both of these are metadata; they may not be directly relevant to the 
filesystem, but are attributes relevant to the client thereof; 
effectively an xattr.  It's not really any different than the fact that 
RFC 2822-style messages frequently contain headers rarely used by either 
MTAs or MUAs; they're metadata provided along the standard format for 
metadata in that system.  In fact, the ability for RFC (2)822 to 
accommodate this type of data has shown to be a major strength of the 
system, as opposed to the uncountably many attempts at binary email formats.
