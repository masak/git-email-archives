Using the pid as a 'random' number is a bad idea. all an attacker
has to do is create 65535 symlinks in /usr/tmp, and he can now
overwrite any file you own.

mktemp is being used here to provide randomness in the filename,
not just a uniqueness.

Attacker doesnt need to touch the script. Just take advantage of
flaws in it, and wait for someone to run it.

I'd suggest fixing your distributions mktemp over going with an
inferior solution.
