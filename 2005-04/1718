Sorry, you've lost me.  Right now the cycle goes like this:

1) patch reads patch file, reads source file, writes source file
2) update-cache reads source file, writes git file

Which of those writes are you avoiding?  We have a smart way to manage the 
cache already for the source files...the vm does pretty well.  There's 
nothing to manage for the git files.  For the apply a bunch of patches 
workload, they are write once, read never (except for the index).
