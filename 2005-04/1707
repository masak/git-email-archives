I'm not sure about the problem you are actually trying to solve, and I
didn't manage to guess it quickly just from the mails themselves;
cg-init /local/path now hardlinks the sha1 objects to the local
.git/objects directory, so you get no space waste. If you are talking
about downloading stuff from remote repositories, http-pull might help.
