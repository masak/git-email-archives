Bit this is a _feature_.

Other people normally shouldn't be interested in your tags. I think it's a 
mistake to make everybody care.

So you normally would fetch only tags you _know_ about. For example, one 
of the reasons we've been _avoiding_ personal tags in teh BK trees is that 
it just gets really ugly really quickly because they get percolated up to 
everybody else. That means that in a BK tree, you can't sanely use tags 
for "private" stuff, like telling somebody else "please sync with this 
tag".

So having the tag in the object database means that fsck etc will notice 
these things, and can build up a list of tags you know about. It also 
means that you can have tag-aware synchronization tools, ie exactly the 
kind of tools that only grab missing commits can also then be used to 
select missing tags according to some _private_ understanding of what tags 
you might want to find..
