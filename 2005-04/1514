I think your "mygitdir" directory has lost its idea of what's in it, so
the fork doesn't know what should be there, either. If it's tracking a
remote repository, you should be able to do a "git pull" there to both
bring it up to date and fix this. Then things should work better.

They should be the same, but now independant as far as commits into them.

The repo contains the latest commit on each side in .git/heads/<name>

It's orthogonal to a tag; it's what stays the same when you do more
commits on something. E.g., linux-scsi or linux-stable would be branch
names. (Tags, on the other hand, stick where you put them.)

I have a tree that I want to modify, but I want to keep the original, and
I may want to update the original from an upstream source (and then sync
my work with it). I start with the original:

  cd original
  git init URL
  git addremote remote-source URL
  git track remote-source

I make my own working directory:

  git fork my-changes ../my-changes
  cd ../my-changes

Then I do my changes, and commit whenever I feel like I've gotten
somewhere (or when I think I'm about to mess something up and might want
to undo changes). Periodically, I check on the mainline:

  cd ../original
  git pull

I also merge changes from the mainline:

  cd ../my-changes
  git merge remote-source

When I'm done, I make a patch for my work:

  cd ../my-changes
  git patch remote-source

I generally then fork the original again, split the patch, apply each
section in the new fork, committing after each one, generate patches for
each of these commits, and send those out. Then I discard my old branch
and continue from the new one. If, at some point, all of the changes I
want to keep have been put into the mainline, I discard all my branches
and fork again from the mainline.

(My personal style is to discard the history of how the changes got made
in favor of the history of how the changes got into the mainline, since I
don't really need to keep all of my debugged mistakes that nobody else
saw.)
