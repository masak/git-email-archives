Just to clarify - individual scripts or $0 name handling?

I kinda like one big script - also means we don't need to 'install' it 
to get access to Cogito.pm...

I'm not sure what you want here; last time you said:

So I dug around Thunderbird's config and, this time, from my email on 
the git list:
--------------050206040606040908050407
Content-Type: application/x-perl;
  name="gitadd.pl"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline;
  filename="gitadd.pl"

will do
