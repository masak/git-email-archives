Hi Ray,

How about two patches.

    1.  s/foo/bar/ throughout file because foo() has been decided upon
    as the name of a new globally visible forthcoming function but was
    already in use as a static function.

    2.  Add definition of new foo().

Patch 1 mustn't be a `darcs replace' despite it changing every occurence
of the C token foo into bar.

Cheers,


Ralph.
