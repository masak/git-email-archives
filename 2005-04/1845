Thanks, that's what I needed to know.

Ahem... you don't expect me to embark on hacking Git without at least
understanding that, do you?

Here we're speaking about the initial import.  Committed on 17 April
2005 by Linus Torvalds, with the comment ``Let it rip''.  220 MB of
changed files in a single commit.  2 minutes real time just to read
all the files, never mind doing anything useful with them.

To put it mildly, Darcs is not optimised for that sort of usage.

> Sorry.  You really need to fix darcs.

That's exactly why we're so interested in your repository.
