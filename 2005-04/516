Btw, before I forget - I did have another reason. I actually think that
the date is potentially a lot more important than "how many parents deep".

In particular, it's entirely possible that the top of my head might be a
veru recent merge that merges with a small fix relative to a very old
parent (making that old parent be just two hops away from the head), while
the thing I want to merge might also have that old parent (for similar
reasons) as a relatively "close" parent from a pure link-counting
standpoint.

The reason I bring this up is that quite often people end up basing their
work on a specific release version, so a merge (especially in specialized
areas) may thus bring such an old parent pretty close to the head, and it
can actually be quite possible (indeed probable) that such a parent ends
up being a common parent.

However, it can easily be a very _bad_ parent.

In ascii barfic:

	        ----------------------- patch ---------
	       /                                        \
	      /                                          \
	- old release -- ... lots of development .. -----HEAD
	     \  \
	      \  \
	       \  ---------------------patch-- MERGE-HEAD      
	        \                             /
		  .. lots of development ..  /

it looks like "old release" is pretty close to both HEAD and MERGE-HEAD, 
right?

But that's just an artifact of the fact that they both had a trivial merge
against some older code, and if the two "lots of development" things have
ever done an earlier merge, there's quite possibly a _much_ better common
parent there somewhere.

I dunno.
