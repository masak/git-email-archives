  Hello Linus,

  I think my tree should be ready for merging with you. It is the final
tree and I've already switched my main branch for it, so it's what
people doing git pull are getting for some time already.

  Its main contents are all of my shell scripts. Apart of that, some
tiny fixes scattered all around can be found there, as well as some
patches which went through the mailing list. My last merge with you
concerned your commit 39021759c903a943a33a28cfbd5070d36d851581.

  It's again

	rsync://pasky.or.cz/git/

this time my HEAD is fba83970090ef54c6eb86dcc2c2d5087af5ac637.

  Note that my rsync tree still contains even my old branch; I thought
I'd leave it around in the public objects database for some time, shall
anyone want to have a look at the history of some of the scripts. But if
you want it gone, tell me and I will prune it (and perhaps offer it in
/git-old/ or whatever). I'm using the following:

	fsck-cache --unreachable $(commit-id) | grep unreachable \
		| cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sed 's/^\(..\)/.git\/objects\/\1\//' \
		| xargs rm

  Thanks,

--
