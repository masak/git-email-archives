It seems to need libcurl-dev... installed.

Error handling could certainly be improved:

pavel@amd:/data/l/cogito$ cg-clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/cogito.git
./cg-clone: line 22: cg-init: command not found
pavel@amd:/data/l/cogito$ PATH=/data/l/cogito:$PATH
pavel@amd:/data/l/cogito$ cg-clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/cogito.git
cg-clone: cogito/ already exists
