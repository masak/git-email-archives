First, show-diff doesn't handle files in the work tree which are not 
listed in the cache.

Have you ever looked at the dontdiff file?  You can get a sample of it 
from http://www.moses.uklinux.net/patches/dontdiff to give you an idea.  
Using grep or filterdiff is really backward in that case since out of 
all the junk that might appear in the output about 98% will be filtered 
away in most useful cases, which is rather inefficient.

Path restriction is inclusive, while the exclude list is, well, 
exclusive.  They serves separate purposes.  So trust me it _is_ pretty 
damn useful, unless you always run "make clean" on your kernel tree 
before checking for potentially uncommitted files then recompile 
everything afterwards which is a hassle.

Agreed.

Sure, but actually I'd prefer for that to be a separate patch since it's 
a tangential issue that might affect show-files as well.
