I'm working off of Linus's tree when not working on scripts, and it
doesn't have that section at all. Should I submit patches to the pasky
tree? (I'm actually tempted to have my own public tree, now that I
wouldn't have to set up anonymous rsync access, aside from the
bootstrapping issue; then I could let people pull and merge instead of
applying patches.)
