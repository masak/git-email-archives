I know that.  However, is that going to be true for all versions of the 
repository format over all time?  If so, the repository format is brittle.

My point was that with a syntactic delimiter, one can write a tool that 
doesn't necessarily know everything about every tag, including future 
tags which may not have been invented when the tool was written.

One can simply say "we don't do that"; finding an unknown tag is always 
a fatal error.  That means the format is more brittle, but brittle does 
mean it breaks as opposed to getting deformed in some, potentially 
undesirable way.
