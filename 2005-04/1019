When someone commits the docs I'll submit the next patch for the README:

commit-tree
	commit-tree <sha1> [-p <parent sha1>...] < changelog

Creates a new commit object based on the provided tree object and
emits the new commit object id on stdout. If no parent is given then
it is considered to be an initial tree.

A commit comment is read from stdin (max 999 chars)

A commit object usually has 1 parent (a commit after a change) or 2
parents (a merge) although there is no reason it cannot have more than
2 parents.

While a tree represents a particular directory state of a working
directory, a commit represents that state in "time", and explains how
to get there.

Normally a commit would identify a new "HEAD" state, and while git
doesn't care where you save the note about that state, in practice we
tend to just write the result to the file ".git/HEAD", so that we can
always see what the last committed state was.

Options

<sha1>
	An existing tree object

-p <parent sha1>
	Each -p indicates a the id of a parent commit object.
	

Commit Information

A commit encapsulates:
	all parent object ids
	author name, email and date
	committer name and email and the commit time.

If not provided, commit-tree uses your name, hostname and domain to
provide author and committer info. This can be overridden using the
following environment variables.
	AUTHOR_NAME
	AUTHOR_EMAIL
	AUTHOR_DATE
	COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME
	COMMIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
(nb <,> and CRs are stripped)
