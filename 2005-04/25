So why is "base64" worse than the stock one?

As mentioned, the "flat" version may be faster, but it really isn't an
option. 32000 objects is peanuts. Any respectable source tree may hit that
in a short time, and will break in horrible ways on many Linux
filesystems.

So you need at least a single level of subdirectory. 

What I don't get is why the stock hex version would be better than base64.

I like the result, I just don't _understand_ it.
