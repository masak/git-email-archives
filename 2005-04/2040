No, that really sucks. 

Realize that "remote" and "local" parents don't really exist. They have no 
meaning. I've considered sorting the parents by the sha1 name, but I've 
left that for now.

Anyway, the reason remote and local don't matter is that if somebody else
merges with me, and I just pull the result without having any changes in 
my tree, we just "fast-forward" to that other side, because otherwise you 
can never "converge" on anything (people merging each others trees would 
always create a new commit, for no good reason).

What does that mean? It means that my local tree now became the _remote_ 
parent, even though it was always local to my tree.

So if you look at remote vs local, you're _guaranteed_ to mess up. It has 
no meaning.

So what you can do is:
 - if there is one parent, just always walk straight down
 - if it's a merge, add the parents _in_date_order_ to the list of things 
   to do, and then pop the most recent one.

Really. You say that dates don't matter, but they _do_ actually matter a
lot more than "remote/local" does. At least they have meaning.
