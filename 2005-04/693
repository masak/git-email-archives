In the case I highlighted, we don't want to end up having to require
user intervention.  This is a common case here, and was one which was
entirely scripted with BK.

Essentially, with BK, at 7am localtime each morning, I'd:

- update my baseline linux 2.6 tree
- for each working tree which may be pulled from
  - if the baseline is a superset
    - update working tree from baseline

The net result is that my workflow consisted entirely of:

1. commit whatever into working tree
2. test
3. send linus a pull request
4. repeat next day

The tree resynchronisation happened completely and entirely in the
background with no user intervention required at all.

With your suggested requirement for user intervention whenever there's
a merge, it means that this just isn't possible - you could automate
the pulls, but you need to ensure that you'd visited each and every
unmerged tree before the next day, or you don't script it at all and
do the whole thing manually.

Hey, I'm lazy, and that means that just won't get done, and my trees
will end up being horrendously out of date all the time.  But isn't
this precisely what we have computers and scripts for?
