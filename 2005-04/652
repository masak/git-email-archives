Okay, I still haven't used git yet (and have only toyed around with
darcs for a bit), so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.
Regardless, I think you may be asking the wrong question. The tracking
of renames was bandied about pretty thoroughly on-list from Wednesday
through Friday (for far better commentary and insight, see Linus'
messages with subject: Merge with git-pasky II.)

git does track changesets that describe the parent tree(s) and the
result. The trees track filenames and hashes. So, doing a fairly
straightforward compare on two trees will let you immediately discover
renames that have occurred, as the filename in the tree changed while
the hash didn't.

So, the question then becomes, can an outside tool cheaply derive all
the information that darcs would need to perform it's work? The renames
should be easy, as long as no content changed during the rename. As for
token replacement (and whitespace changes, etc.), that could be
discovered via domain-specific parsers (something specific per language,
for example). Linus tossed a link to one such tool (hmm, where was it.
Sheesh. You sure right a lot, dude :-).)

...which should be viewed more as a proof-of-concept than a mergeable
code-set. It does show that diff's vocabulary is sadly lacking in
expressiveness, and improving that, I think, would be a useful area to
expend effort. 

Again, I may be off here, especially considering I've a backlog of a
couple hundred messages to read since the weekend. (You guys need to go
outside more often.)
