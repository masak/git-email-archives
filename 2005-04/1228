If someone is motivated enough, and if the task is quite trivial (as it
seems to be) someone may try it. I can see nothing wrong with it as long
as it doesn't affect other people.

Of course. But one may consider using a filesystem with, say, different
settings. Or a special filesystem for this task, such as CNFS used by
news servers (it seems news servers do quite the same what git does,
except they also purge old contents, i.e., container files don't grow up).

The optimization would be (in) the underlying filesystem (i.e., the OS
thing, or possibly a shared preloaded library?), not git itself.
