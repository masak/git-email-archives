Huh?  I'm saving 19 registers, r13..r31, and not saving 13, namely
r0..r12.

The dodgy thing *I'm* thinking of is saving %r2 (the TOC pointer)
and using it as an extra temporary.  (The alternative is spilling
one of the "old" hash values to the stack, which is not
too big a disaster.)

Damn.  So that's actually *worse* than me earlier version which achieved
an (also piddling) 2% speedup?
As you can see, I tried to make the addition tree bushier, but I guess
it didn't help.  Or the processor isn't out-of-order enough to find
the parallelism I made available.

Damn, I wish I had at that IBM pipeline profiling tool.  If it could
just tell me which cycles didn't have both ALUs busy, I could solve it
in relatively little time.

The place that could really use scheduing help is the G4, which has three
integer ALUs, but can only *think* about executing the bottom three entries
in the reorder queue.  So if one of those instructions isn't ready, it
stalls in the queue and idles the ALU with it.

Especially there, it may be necessary to interleave the EXPANDW code
with the round code to avoid having the (non-critical-path) EXPANDW
code scheduled ahead of critical-path round code.

The two critical-path inter-round dependencies are:
- summing into E to be rotated by 5 and added to D next round.
  (this is the "A<<<5" code in the current round)
- rotating B left for use in the next round's F(a,b,c) function.
  (this is the current round's C input)
Actually, the E variable isn't critical-path at all; it was last
modified several rounds ago.

Maybe I can improve the scheduling some more...
