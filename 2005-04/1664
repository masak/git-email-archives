Good, applied.

This also makes me think that we should just make "show-diff" show the
same format, at which point show-diff actually matches all the other
tools, and it is likely to make show-diff more useful to boot.

The thing I personally use "show-diff" for these days is actually just to
check whether I have anything dirty in my tree, and then it would actually
be preferable to just get the filenaname printout (in the same old
"diff-cache" format) rather than the full diff.

Maybe rename the "show-diff" command to be "cache-diff", and if somebody
wants the old "show-diff" thing, just have a script that does

	#!/bin/sh
	cache-diff | diff-tree-helper

and nothing more.

Talking about renaming, at some point we really should prepend "git-" to 
all the git commands. I didn't want to do the extra typing when I started 
out and was unsure about the name, but hey, by now we really should.

Junio, what do you think?
