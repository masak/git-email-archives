but the specific scenario you described would require _Linus'_ tree to 
be in limbo for a long time, and have uncommitted half-done edits. I.e.:

   (A1B2)--(A2B2)--(A2'B3)
    /  \   /            \
   /    \ /              \
 (A1B1)  X               (...)
   \    / \              /
    \  /   \            /
   (A2B1)--(A2B2)--(A3B2')

in the above scenario Linus' tree needs to 'cross' with a maintainer's 
tree.  (maintainer's tree wont cross with another maintainer's tree, as 
maintainer-to-maintainer merges rare.)

but for the scenario to occur, i think there needs to be a prolongued 
"limbo" period in Linus' tree for a 'crossing' to happen. But Linus' 
merges are typically almost atomic: they are done then they are pushed 
out. It's definitely not in the 'days, sometimes weeks' timescale as 
maintainer trees are.

so for the scenario to occur, a maintainer, from whom Linus has just 
pulled an update and Linus is merging the tree manually without 
comitting, has to pull a file from the earlier Linus tree, and then 
Linus has to modify that same file again. This does not seem to be a 
common scenario.

so i think to avoid the scenario, maintainers should not pull from each 
other - they should only pull/push to/from Linus' tree. Maybe this is an 
unacceptable limitation?
