I think this should be possible with a different tag than "tree". All the
bits aren't sufficient, anyway; the unincluded values include the user and
group, which are likely to matter for some things in /etc. But there's no
reason that the core can't support both a system-local complete
representation of the dentry and a user-relative representation of a
source distribution with different tags.

For that matter, it could accept "dir" objects in commits as well, and use
version-control-type logic on history while refusing to do non-sensical
things with them.
