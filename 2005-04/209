Or if one does not care about space,  and simply want's speed,  add another
layer of indirection - a flattened container object which has hashses as
normal,  then as it's content simply has the 'chunk list object' and the
'chunk objects' concatenated.

It's then a per user / database as to if the flattened objects,  or the
heirarcal objects are storred locally.
