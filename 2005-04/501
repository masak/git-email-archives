Btw, you don't even have to really remember the head you merged with. If 
you have all my objects, you can just use the current head from whatever 
my repository is, and the "rev-tree" will show all your commit objects 
that aren't in my tree.

The only reason I said "remember the last head you merged" is that that 
way you don't even have to download the objects from my tree, and you can 
make the decision totally locally without looking at what I've done since.

Of course, at some point you want to get my updated objects _anyway_, 
but..
