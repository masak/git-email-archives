Dear diary, on Sat, Apr 16, 2005 at 07:04:31PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

FWIW, it looks pretty reasonable to me. Perhaps we should have a
separate GIT repository with the previous history though, and in the
first new commit the parent could point to the last commit from the
other repository.

Just if it isn't too much work, though. :-)
