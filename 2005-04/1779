Renaming or moving files is _so_ rare and unusual that even not implementing
it (like CVS) is hardly a big issue. Even in the linux kernel people moved subsystems
around - OSS went from drivers/sound to /sound/oss in 2.6, and a USB subdirectory
moved too, I think.

The patch got bigger. People wasted 30 seconds more of their life because the .gz
file was bigger - who cares? If it's something it's going to happen every 5 years,
I'd rather move them like CVS does rather than wasting a single second
implementing file renaming/moving...

If something so uncommon like file renaming has been implemented, I don't see
why people shouldn't implement something really useful like the thing linus
proposes, in fact it doesn't looks like a bad idea at all (and you'd get
file renaming for free, too). Perhaps it would be hard to implement and get
right, but at least it would be _useful_.
