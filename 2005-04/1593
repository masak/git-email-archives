Hi,

Thanks for all the help!

OK, I think I understand this so far. So, suppose I want to contribute to
cogito. I would first do a git init on Pasky's cogito tree, to get it on my home
system. This would be my home base, and whenever I wanted to do some work on the
current state of his tree, I would fork off another branch.

So, I want to do this. From inside cogito's root directory, I give the command

git fork mycogito ../mycogito

and ../mycogito is created. In this new directory, the .git directory
contains only symlinks to ../cogito/HEAD, ../cogito/heads, ../cogito/objects,
../cogito/remotes, and ../cogito/tags, and an index file.

Question: when I make changes to mycogito and commit them, is only the index
file in .git/ altered, or are my changes reflected in the cogito/ directory as
well? If I do another fork of cogito, will I see mycogito's changes in the new
fork?

So moving on, I now have this mycogito tree. But I don't do any edits yet. I
just poke around for awhile, reading files. Finally I realize that there have
probably been updates to the upstream sources, and I want to pull those in
before I start my work. So, as I would do in the cogito directory, I give the
command

git pull pasky; git pull linus

this works fine. There are no new updates to be had, and git tells me my tree is
uptodate.

so now I start work. I run aspell on the README file, and it catches some
typos.  I fix them and save the file but don't yet commit it. Now mycogito
has some changes that I would ultimately like to push up to Pasky.

Now I'm unclear what comes next. Do I just do a 'git diff' from the mycogito
directory and post the results to the git list?

Suppose I want to keep working, changing more stuff in mycogito, but I also want
to make sure that mycogito tracks the upstream sources.

Would I just do

git pull pasky; git pull linus

and give that command whenever I wanted to grab the latest changes? What would
happen if there were upstream conflicts with my work on mycogito?

Or do I have that wrong. Instead of a pull, would I now only do

git merge pasky; git merge linus

and give that command to bring the upstream changes into mycogito?

Basically, once I'm editing files in mycogito, what commands to I give to bring
mycogito uptodate WRT the upstream sources? When I'm finally ready, and all my
changes have been committed into mycogito, what command do I give to produce a
patch to send to the git list?

Be well,
Zack
