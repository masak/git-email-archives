I don't think I'm following the use of branches. Currently, what I do is
have a git-pasky and a git-linus, and fork off a working directory from
one of these for each thing I want to work on. I do some work, commit as I
make progress, and then do a diff against the remote head to get a patch
to send off. If I want to do a series of patches which depend on each
other, I fork my next directory off of my previous one rather than off of
a remote base. I haven't done much rebasing, so I haven't worked out how I
would do that most effectively.

I think I can make this space efficient by hardlinking unmodified blobs to
a directory of cached expanded blobs.
