Dear diary, on Fri, Apr 15, 2005 at 12:37:57AM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...

Good. :-)

Sounds good.

I don't really care about this too much, although I personally prefer
the old-style comments. // comments are C99 so -pedantic by itself
should have no right to complain about it.

> * show-diff.c: Fix handling of more than one option of the command line.

What exactly does it fix? The current code seems fine to my sleepy
brain.

> Add new option "-c" to omit checksums for modified files.  Expand help.

How is the -c option useful?

Could you please send your patch with the correct inline settings on the
attachment (or just in the mail body) and signed off?

Thanks,
