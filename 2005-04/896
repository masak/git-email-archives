Same here, I have been toying the idea to using git as quilt back
end then I can get rid of the .pc/ directory in quilt.

But think about it more, I don't get a good reason to do it.
quilt as it is, works great with git or other SCM. Using git to
store the quilt patches will require merge more often, instead of
just applying patches. Introduce more steps and more objects to clean
up later on. It seems that every thing I have been using quilt for,
it is easier just deal with the series patches.
