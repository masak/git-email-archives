Yes, and replace patches need to be used very carefully.

Yes. See my hello world example from my last email.

Yes, depending on how you define wrong. Darcs replace is fully 
predictable, and poorly chosen replaces can lead to incorrect results 
after future patches are applied.

Absolutely correct, and the exact reason why replace patches need to be 
used *very* selectively.

See hello world example in my other email. You can argue that it is an 
existing problem in darcs, but really, it just points out the fact that 
a computer is *incapable* of knowing whether it is safe to use a replace 
patch based on a diff because replace patches are dangerous if not used 
intelligently.
