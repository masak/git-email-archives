I've also seen non thread-safe GUID generation, using MD5m hit collisions:
but of course that was due to the fact that the code had thread safety
issues, not because anyone actually ever hit a MD5 collision...

Of course there are constructed cases of MD5 collision, but those are
pretty disinteresting.  Give me two files that have useful content and
the same hash, and then I'll be impressed.

Linus has already weighed in that he doesn't give a crap.  All the
crypto-babble about collision whitepapers is uninteresting without a
repo that has real collisions.  git is far too cool as is - prove I
should be concerned.
