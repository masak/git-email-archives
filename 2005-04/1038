I'm working on it.  The format was chosen so that blobs under 1 block long 
*stay* 1 block long; i.e. there's no 'chunk plus index file' overhead.
So the chunking should only kick in on multiple-block files.
I hacked 'convert-cache' to do the conversion and it's running out of
memory on linux-2.6.git, however --- I found a few memory leaks in your 
code =) but I certainly seem to be missing a big one still (maybe it's in 
my code!).

When I get this working properly, my plan is to do a number of runs over 
the linux-2.6 archive trying out various combinations of chunking 
parameters.  I *will* be watching both 'real' disk usage (bunged up to 
block boundaries) and 'ideal' disk usage (on a reiserfs-type system).
The goal is to improve both, but if I can improve 'ideal' usage 
significantly with a minimal penalty in 'real' usage then I would argue 
it's still worth doing, since that will improve network times.

The handshaking penalties you mention are significant, but that's why 
rsync uses a pipelined approach.  The 'upstream' part of your full-duplex 
pipe is 'free' while you've got bits clogging your 'downstream' 
pipe.  The wonders of full-duplex...

Anyway, "numbers talk, etc".  I'm working on them.
