Do you agree that installing a new libgit.so when you want to apply such a
tool to a new tag is sufficient? If the library is shared, and everything
for parsing the objects (to the point of getting struct object filled
out) is in the library, and you want to have some tool able to validate or
use any new tag that you want reachability-only tools to process, not
having a standard header proto-format for future tags isn't a problem,
since you'll get upgrades to the parser portion of all of your tools
together.
