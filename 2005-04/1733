reiserfs shares the same basic data=ordered idea as ext3, so the fsync will do 
the same on reiser as it does on ext3.  I do have code in there to try and 
keep the data=ordered writeback a little less bursty than it is in ext3 so 
you might not notice the fsync as much.

I haven't compared reiser vs ext3 for git.  reiser tails should help 
performance because once you read the object inode you've also got the data.  
But, I would expect the biggest help to come from mounting reiserfs -o 
alloc=skip_busy.  This basically allocates all new files one right after the 
other on disk regardless of which subdir they are in.  The effect is to time 
order most of your files.

As an example, here's the time to apply 300 patches on ext3.  This was with my 
packed patches applied, but vanilla git should show similar percentage 
differences.

data=writeback  32s			
data=ordered    44s

With a long enough test, data=ordered should fall into the noise, but 10-40 
second runs really show it.
