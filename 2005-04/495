Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 17, 2005 at 08:49:11PM CEST, I got a letter
where Daniel Barkalow <barkalow@iabervon.org> told me that...

Sorry, counted one '/' more. :-)

I'm not too kind at this. Either make it totally separate commands, or
make a required switch specifying what to do. Otherwise it implies the
switches would just modify what it does, but they make it do something
completely different.

-a would be fine too - basically a combination of -c and -t. I'd imagine
that is what Linus would want to use, e.g.

Can't you just stop the recursion when you hit a commit you already
have?
