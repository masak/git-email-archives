I've made a proposal like the following:

.git/
  objects/    (traditional)
  refs/       Directories of hex SHA1 + newline files
    heads/    Commits which are heads of various sorts
    tags/     Tags, by the tag name (or some local renaming of it)
  info/       Other shared information
    remotes
  ...         Everything else isn't shared
  HEAD        Symlink to refs/heads/<something>

The plumbing doesn't care what you name heads or tags, but expects things
to be in heads to be commit objects and tags to be tag objects (which can
tag whatever).

AFAICT, there is general concensus that this is how things should be, but
I haven't convinced Linus that the plumbing should know about anything
other than objects/.
