Dear diary, on Thu, Apr 28, 2005 at 03:31:18AM CEST, I got a letter
where Daniel Barkalow <barkalow@iabervon.org> told me that...

The user. ;-)

Apparently, too many people were confused by the local/remote branches
distinctions, and even I ceased to like it gradually (BTW, Cogito still
supports working with them - it just does not offer any interface for
manipulation with them). The current scheme is much simpler and I
believe more clear.

Also, the forked repositories were not truly independent - people
actually got burnt by forking and then removing the original repository.

If this breaks your workflow, could you please describe it? Perhaps we
could find a good semantics to support both.
