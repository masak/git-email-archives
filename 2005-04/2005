I dropped the regexes for speed with diff-tree, they weren't that important to 
me...The features I was going for are:

1) ability to see the changeset comments in the output.
2) ability to look for revs on more than one file at a time.  The single file 
limit in bk revtool always bugged me.
3) Some quick cut n' paste method to generate the changeset diff.  This is why 
I do diff-tree -r in the output, so I can just copy into a different window 
and go.

Your c version would hopefully end up faster on cpu time by limiting the 
number of times we read/decompress the commit files.
