It won't. It will see that those two aren't interesting, because they 
don't match the pathname, so it will ignore them regardless of whether 
there is a -r or not.

Well, if you give pathnames, it's always going to limit recursion to only 
those subdirectories that match one of them. 

And if you don't give pathnames, then nor recursing will do something 
pretty strange, ie give a diff of only the files in the top-level 
directory, and totally ignore the subdirectories that did change:

and then

	torvalds@ppc970:~/v2.6/linux> diff-tree -p e8108c98dd6d65613fa0ec9d2300f89c48d554bf $(cat .git/HEAD)
	<no output what-so-ever>

where showing things as if nothing changed seems to be actively _wrong_, 
I'd say..
