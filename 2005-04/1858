That's true for email addresses, but the point was to distinguish links 
to other git objects from any other kind of text.  Currently there is no 
such delimiter for that.  Another solution than the one I posted would 
be to define such a delimiter, for example '<' + 20 hex character + '>' 
(which would be distinguished from email addresses by the lack of an @ 
sign.)  That would be a repo change, though.

Given no prior constraints, I would probably argue for a format which 
makes the data type known as a matter of syntax, using "..." quoted 
strings for *ALL* arbitrary strings, a different syntax for numbers and 
links, and leaving the door open for new data types like lists in the 
future.
