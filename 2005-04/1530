If you were to create those files at 10^9 files per second, it would
take you 10^38 years before you were in position to take step 5. I am
about to turn 38 this week. Would that I could live to 10^38.

It's absolute rubbish to say that the best solution from an
<double-quote>engineering</double-quote> point of view is to eliminate
the infinitessimal possibility of a collision. Engineering is all
about assessing risk and making suitable trade-offs. Every day of the
week, "real" engineers accept life-threatening risks that put
thousands of peoples lives in danger. They do it because we live in a
world where risk cannot be eliminated, merely reduced to an acceptable
level.

I can't understand that you are a prepared to drive a car or fly in a
Boeing or Airbus that has a demonstrated risk of killing you, yet you
want to insist on eliminating a risk that at most might create an
interesting Slashdot headline: "Jolt-crazed programmer finds SHA1
collision - but later dies when whale falls on house".
