That may sound like a good idea, but it's horrid.

You'd only have to gather them back later anyway, since you can only apply 
the mode change _after_ you've done the diff. Why? The diff may be the 
thing that creates the file in the first place. Sp you should consider the 
mode changes as part of the "stream", not as something separate from the 
stream.

So I'd really much rather see it more as an "Index" line, which gets
prepended as part of the patch for that file (of course, either patch or
modeline can be missing).
