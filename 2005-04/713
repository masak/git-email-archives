Yes, that's what I did to get back to the commit just before the merge:

fsck-cache --unreachable 54ff646c589dcc35182d01c5b557806759301aa3|awk
'/^unreachable /{print $2}'|sed 's:^\(..\):.git/objects/\1/:'|xargs rm

removes all the objects from the tree prior to the bogus commit---it's
based on your (Linus') git-prune-script.
