I imagine quite a few folks expect something not entirely unlike an SCM
to emerge from these current efforts. Moreover, Petr's 'git' scripts
wrap your "filesystem" plumbing to that very end.

To avoid confusion, I think it would be better to distinguish the two
layers, perhaps by calling the low-level plumbing... 'gitfs', of course.
