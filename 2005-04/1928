all you have to do is to make sure that convert-cache doesn't loose any 
data and you can always convert back (through as many steps as needed) to 
check signatures.

no matter what you do, if you change the thing that's being signed the 
signature is worthless, it doesn't matter if you change it in a flexible 
or a brittle way, it's different. the brittle approach actually makes it 
easier to go backwards as you KNOW exactly what it needs to be, there's no 
possiblity that a later tag was there, but being ignored (except for the 
signature)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
