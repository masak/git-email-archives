Yeah, I think I'll make the "tree-diff" functions be available to others,
since they are actually _very_ cheap, and it's a bit sad to have to
execute a whole new process just to get a tree-diff. Then writing some
rev-list thing that just does tree-diff between different versions should
be trivial and quite efficient for finding things like "when did this set
of files/subdirectory last change".

Which definitely is very useful information.
