Thanks.  I originally called diff-tree without the file list so that I could 
do the regexp matching, but this is probably one of those features that will 
never get used.

My test case here is a tree with 400 commits, giving diff-tree the file list 
brings us down from 16s to 9s on a cold cache.  Hot cache is about 1.5 
seconds on both.

Usually the question I will want to ask is "how did foo.c change since tag X", 
which usually won't go back more then a few months.   This should be 
reasonable, and I'd rather not slow down common operations adding extra 
indexing for the uncommon file-changes run.

So, new prog attached.  New usage:

file-changes [-c commit_id] [-s commit_id] file ...

-c is the commit where you want to start searching
-s is the commit where you want to stop searching
