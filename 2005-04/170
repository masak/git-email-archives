I suspect that finding the common commit is actually a per-file thing;
it's not just something you do for the _commit_ graph, then use for
merging each file in the two branches you're trying to merge.

Consider a simple repository which contains two files A and B. We start
off with the first version of each ('A1B1'), and the owner of each file
takes a branch and modifies their own file. There is cross-pulling
between the two, and then each modifies the _other's_ file as well as
their own...

   (A1B2)--(A2B2)--(A2'B3)
    /  \   /            \
   /    \ /              \
 (A1B1)  X               (...)
   \    / \              /
    \  /   \            /
   (A2B1)--(A2B2)--(A3B2')

Now, we're trying to merge the two branches. It appears that the most
useful common ancestor to use for a three-way merge of file A is the
version from tree 'A2B1', while the most useful common ancestor for
merging file B is that in 'A1B2'.

(I think it's a coincidence that in my example the useful files 'A2' and
'B2' actually do end up in a single tree together at some point.)
