Dear diary, on Mon, Apr 18, 2005 at 02:06:43AM CEST, I got a letter
where David Woodhouse <dwmw2@infradead.org> told me that...

I'm confused by this paragraph, but that might be my English skills
failing somehow.

Yes, that's what I suggested too.

I think http-pull is very promising. :-)

It could be actually much faster than rsync, since you don't need to
build directory listings etc, which actually takes non-trivial amount of
time already with the kernel git repository.
