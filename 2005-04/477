They should't, but maybe I should add COMMITTER_xxx overrides. I just do 
_not_ want people to think that they should claim to be somebody else: 
it's not a security issue (you could compile your own "commit-tree.c" 
after all), it's more of a "social rule" thing. I prefer seeing bad email 
addresses that at least match the system setup to seeing good email 
addresses that people made up just to make them look clean.

Mind showing what your /etc/passwd file looks like (just your own entry, 
and please just remove your password entry if you don't use shadow 
passwords).

Maybe I should just remove _all_ strange characters when I do the name 
cleanup in "commit". Right now I just remove the ones that matter to 
parsing it unambiguosly: '\n' '<' and '>'.

(The ',' character really is special: some people have

	Torvalds, Linus

and maybe I should not just remove the commas, I should convert it to 
always be "Linus Torvalds". But your gecos entry is just _strange_. Why 
the extra commas, I wonder?)
