But older history can be pruned, and there's really no reason why an
http-based 'git pull' couldn't simply refrain from fetching commits
older than a certain threshold.

However, we can't _add_ the history if the current commits don't refer
to it. I really think we should take the imported git history and make
our 'current' tree refer to it -- even if just by having an appropriate
'parent' record in what is currently the oldest changeset in our tree;
the 2.6.12-rc2 import.

It doesn't matter that our oldest commit object refers to a nonexistent
parent, but that does allow us to import historical data if we _want_
to, and have it all work properly.

We should have the full historical git repo available within a day or
so, I believe. It would be really useful if we could make the current
trees refer back to that, instead of starting at 2.6.12-rc2.
