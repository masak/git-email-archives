Just in case someone else is considering trying it, I've just written a
pair of programs to transfer a commit and everything it uses directly over
ssh (i.e., without rsync); it is also clever enough to reject anything
that either doesn't inflate or doesn't hash correctly. It also doesn't
transfer anything that the recipient already has or doesn't need.

I have some more cleaning to go on it, but I could post it if others want
to hack on it.
