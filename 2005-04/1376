Yes, totally agreed.

Okay now you're just being difficult <g>   You're acting like it's
impossible for git to grab the SHA1 out of the clear text message if there
is signing overhead above the tag reference.   That is nonesense.   You
simply state that tag must include a SHA1 object reference preceded by
"REF:" in the comment.   Git can surely use this regardless of what
signing overhead is above, below or beside it.   The suggestion for
stripping out the signing overhead was for _human_ readability; git won't
care a gnit.
