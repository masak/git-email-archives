Hi,

It seems that there's something weird going on with the file mode
handling.  Firstly, some files in the git-pasky repository have mode
0664 while others have 0644.

Having pulled from git-pasky a number of times, with Petr's being the
"tracked" repository, I now find that when I do an update-cache --refresh,
it complains that the files need updating, despite show-diff showing no
differences.  Investigating, this appears to be because the file modes
are wrong for a number of the files.  All my files do not have group
write.

I notice in the changelog what appears to be a dependence on the umask.
If this is so, please note that git appears to track the file modes,
and any dependence upon the umask is likely to screw with this tracking.
