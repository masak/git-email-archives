As I have suggested in a previous message, it is trivial to implement adaptive
indexing: there is no need to hardwire a specific indexing scheme.  Furthermore,
I suspect that the optimal size of subkeys may well depend on the filesystem.
My experiments seem to indicate that subkeys of length 2 achieve an excellent
compromise between discriminatory power and disk footprint on ext2.

Btw, if, as you indicate above, you do believe that a 1 level indexing should
use [0:2], then it doesn't make much sense to me to also suggest that a 2 level
indexing should use [0:1] as primary subkey :-)

Cheers,
