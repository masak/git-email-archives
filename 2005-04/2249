It sounds good - but could you efficiently collect them before any diff
output?  If you have something like this, it'll be easy to read:

Mode change: 644->755 foo.sh
Mode change: 644->755 bar.sh

--- ChangeLog
+++ ChangeLog
@@ -1,0 +1,1 @@
+New line
--- copyright
+++ copyright
@@ -1,0 +1,1 @@
+New line


But if you generate this then you might as well not generate the mode
lines at all, for all a human looking at the diff is going to notice
them:

--- ChangeLog
+++ ChangeLog
@@ -1,0 +1,1 @@
+New line
Mode change: 644->755 foo.sh
--- copyright
+++ copyright
@@ -1,0 +1,1 @@
+New line
Mode change: 644->755 bar.sh


The latter is how diff does its "Only in" messages.  I never see them
when I'm looking through a diff of any size; only via diffstat, where
they're clearly disambiguated.
