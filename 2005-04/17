Actually, the subdirectory hack has the same effect, so you lose 
regardless.  Doesn't mean that you can't construct cases where the 
subdirectory hack doesn't win, but I maintain that those are likely to 
be artificial.

It's probably worth noting that you have to assume htree is on, since 
that's the typical default for a Linux installation, even if you use the 
subdirectory hack.
