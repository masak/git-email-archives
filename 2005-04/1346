This is a cool idea. When the concept is rendered this way, it sounds
a lot like some of the core principles in the architecture of the
Lotus Notes replication engine. I've always thought it would be cool
to have an open engine that provided similar functionality to the
Lotus Notes replication engine without the naff programming
environment that sits on top. I can see how the git concepts and code
could provide the basis of such a solution. Very cool.
