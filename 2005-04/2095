There isn't anything preventing optomized transfer protocols for git. 
Give it time.

Scanning back through the history is a linear operation and will quite
likely be just fine for many uses.   As others have pointed out, you can
cache the result to improve subsequent lookups.

There's nothing preventing this in the longer term.  And you know, we're
only talking about a few megabytes per release.  We're not talking about
video here.


> - no way to do efficient delta storage

This has been discussed.  It is a recognized and accepted design
trade-off.  Disk is cheap.


> - no way to do merges based on the file's history[1]

What is preventing merges from looking back through the git history?



The fundamental design of git is essentially done, it is what it is.

Your concearns are about performance rather than real limitations and it's
just too damn early in the development process for that.  Frankly it's
amazing how good git is considering its age; it's already _way_ faster and
easier to use than bk ever was for my use.

I've been tying to figure out what this means for a while now <g>
