Dear diary, on Thu, Apr 28, 2005 at 04:06:29AM CEST, I got a letter
where Nicolas Pitre <nico@cam.org> told me that...
> In the same spirit as diff-tree and diff-cache, here is a diff-files

Except some usage enhancement, how does this differ from show-diff?

Also, for some reason you have update-cache.c in your patch too.
