So, what would be an appropriate comment for that commit? I have no idea
what is changing on my tree in that case, all I know is that I'm merging from
someone else. All I really want is their changes and their commit messages,
not one of my own that is meaningless.

So far I just type ^d when this happens, and leave the commit message blank.

Be well,
Zack
