Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 17, 2005 at 08:13:59PM CEST, I got a letter

I tend to agree here. My toilet stuff is what can handle various
locale-based conversions at the commit-tree / cat-file tree sides etc,
but UTF-8 should be certainly the way to go internally.

Not that the plumbing should actually _care_ at all; anyone who uses it
should take the care, so this is more of a "social" thing.
