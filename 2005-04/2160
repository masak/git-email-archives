That's right.   I'm saying that Joe needn't rely on the tree at all since
he should be having his tools verify its contents anyway.  Given that, 
he may as well have his tools *generate* the tree.  Having generated the tree,
it's gravy to then verify that it matches the tree the submitter thought he
was sending -- that's a *secondary* checksum where `git' currently uses
it as primary.

In the real world, that "review" step is the weak link.  When it goes
wrong, the first step is to make sure we are reviewing a tree everyone
involved *intended* -- and it's only with signed diffs adding up to
that tree that we get there.
