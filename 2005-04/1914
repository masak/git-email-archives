Dear diary, on Wed, Apr 27, 2005 at 06:43:38AM CEST, I got a letter
where Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org> told me that...

Ouch.

Well, using -r v2.6.12-rc3: is a workable workaround, but this is a
problem. With the trailing :, you are diffing against your latest
commit, whilst without the trailing :, you are diffing against your
working tree. ;-)

The problem is in how the latter is implemented:

        export GIT_INDEX_FILE=$(mktemp -t gitdiff.XXXXXX)
        cp .git/index $GIT_INDEX_FILE
        read-tree -m $(tree-id "$id1")
        update-cache --refresh
        tree=$(tree-id "$id1")
	diff-cache -r -z $tree | xargs -0 cg-Xdiffdo ...

So, we are recording our adds to the index cache, but here we use a
different one with the adds are not recorded - so diff-cache won't catch
them.

So I fixed this by doing diff-cache --cached and updating the tmp index
by the +- entries. Pushed out, thanks.
