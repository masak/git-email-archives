There is gitXnormid.sh in the current cogito.  Please update your tree.

That's not what I see if I remove cat-file but leave commit-id in my
$HOME/bin:

proski@dv:~/src/cogito$ make cg-version
/home/proski/bin/commit-id: line 35: cat-file: command not found
Invalid id: f9f0459b5b39cf83143c91ae39b4eaf187cf678a
Generating cg-version...

That would be fine with me.

It should be a conditional dependency, i.e. it should be a dependency
if .git exists.

It seems to me that the whole idea of including SHA1 in cg-version is
broken.  SHA1 is not human readable.  But if the maintainers insist on
having SHA1 in cg-version, I want it to be done without causing build
warnings for new users.

Here's an alternative patch.
