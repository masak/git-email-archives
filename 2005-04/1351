Ok, don't bother looking into this - I'm now completely git-free here.
I think I'll prefer to use the old diff and patch method to submit
stuff to Linus, until git has progressed sufficiently such that it
doesn't end up wasting hours of my time.

Yes, it's a radical solution, but since I _can't_ get it to work for
me, it's the only one which will allow me to get any real work done.

(and it all looked soo promising pre-0.6.2)
