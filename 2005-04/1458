Yes. :)  In previous experiments (in the context of trying different
ways to do memcpy) I found that doing unaligned word loads is faster
than doing aligned loads plus extra rotate and mask instructions to
get the bytes you want together.

The reason I used more than one temporary is that I was trying to put
dependent instructions as far apart as reasonably possible, to
minimize the chances of pipeline stalls.  Given that the 970 does
register renaming and out-of-order execution, I don't know how
essential that is, but it can't hurt.

A sequence of adds into a single register is going to incur the
2-cycle latency between generation and use of a value; i.e. the adds
will only issue on every second cycle.  I think we are better off
making the dataflow more like a tree than a linear chain where
possible.

That's cute, I hadn't thought of that.

Not in the ppc32 ELF ABI - you are not supposed to touch memory below
the stack pointer.  The kernel is more forgiving than that, and in
fact you can currently use the red zone without anything bad
happening, but you really shouldn't.

I believe the stw/lwz and the stmw/lmw will actually execute at the
same speed on the 970, but I have seen lwz/stw go faster than lmw/stmw
on other machines.  In any case we aren't executing the prolog and
epilog as often as the instructions in the main loop, hopefully.

True.

That's cool.

I added a stwu and an addi to make a stack frame, and changed %r15 to
%r5 as you mentioned in another message.  I tried it in a little test
program I have that calls SHA1_Update 256,000 times with a buffer of
4096 zero bytes, i.e. it processes 1000MB.  Your version seems to be
about 2% faster; it took 4.53 seconds compared to 4.62 for mine.  But
it also gives the wrong answer; I haven't investigated why.

Thanks,
Paul.
