Not that it is worth that much, but my $0.02 is that Petr is right on
this one. I want something that allows me to get the objects into my
local repository without funking with my working directory.

As a long time CVS user, "git update" would do what I expect it to. I
don't have any pre-conceptions about what "pull" does, so it doesn't
phase me if pull is used for this purpose. However, perhaps pull means
something in some other SCM that would cause confusion for others?

Some alternatives to "pull" are offered: hoard, gather, make-local, download.

Regards,

jon.
