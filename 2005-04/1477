Ewww. I missed that in the documentation. I suppose I should have worked
it out having empirically determined that it ignores the tm_gmtoff
field.

I don't think we want to be in the business of counting leap seconds; we
need to let the system do it. I don't much like setting TZ to UTC though
-- how about we use your test case to find the offset and subtract that?

Does this work?
