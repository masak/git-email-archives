Yes.

You'll need another pair of quotes for that:

[ "$(sed -ne "/^$name\t/p" .git/remotes)" ]; echo $?

If I remember correctly from my Autoconf hacking experience, not all
shells like mixing quotes and command substitution, and even bash
treated this differently in different versions.  I can do more research,
but it seems just too fragile to me.

Another thing I remember is that "case" would not need quotes.  For some
historic reasons, the expression between "case" and "in" is subjected to
command substitution, but not word expansion.

So the patch becomes:

--- a/gittrack.sh
+++ b/gittrack.sh
@@ -35,9 +35,11 @@ die () {
 mkdir -p .git/heads
 
 if [ "$name" ]; then
-	grep -q $(echo -e "^$name\t" | sed 's/\./\\./g') .git/remotes || \
+	case x$(sed -ne "/^$name\t/p" .git/remotes) in
+	x)
 		[ -s ".git/heads/$name" ] || \
-		die "unknown branch \"$name\""
+		die "unknown branch \"$name\"" ;;
+	esac
 
 	echo $name >.git/tracking
 
Looks rather ugly for my taste, but just in case:

By the way, please check all references to .git/remotes - this bug is
not specific to gittrack.sh.
