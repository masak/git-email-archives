Is there a way to check out a tree without changing the mtime of any
files that you have already checked out and which are the same as the
version you are checking out?  It seems that checkout-cache -a doesn't
overwrite any existing files, and checkout-cache -f -a overwrites all
files and gives them the current mtime.  This is a pain if you are
using make and your tree is large (like, for instance, the linux
kernel :), because it means that after a checkout-cache -f -a you get
to recompile everything.

Paul.
