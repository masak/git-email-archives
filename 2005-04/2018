You can pull from local repositories? I think that having the same concept
for remote repositories and for different lines of local development is
what confuses users.

I'll be using rpush and he'd have to use http-pull (I don't have rsync
set up); both of these only transfer the reachable objects, so cleanliness
isn't an issue.

But that doesn't work; when I'm preparing the second patch in the series,
I want to compare linus+patch 1 against barkalow, so that I'm looking at
what's left to split. That's why I need to have the unrelated heads, not
just the linus head and my head based on it. If I go back to linus each
time, it's more work making the patches and I don't have an easy way of
telling whether I've included the same part twice or missed a part.
