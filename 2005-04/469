Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 17, 2005 at 05:24:48PM CEST, I got a letter
where Russell King <rmk@arm.linux.org.uk> told me that...

I think it would look nicer if you used git log format. Actually...

 
> #!/bin/sh
> prev=$(cat .git/heads/origin)
> to=$(cat .git/HEAD)

It is preferred to use the commit-id command instead; when git decides
to totally dig over its metametadata storage, you won't need to care.

> this=$to
> while [ "$this" != "$prev" ]; do
>   cat-file commit $this | sed 's,.*,\t&,'
>   this=$(cat-file commit $this | grep ^parent | cut -d ' ' -f 2)
> done

What about adding support to git log for not caring about side branches
(if there are multiple parents, go only over the first one; you might
add that as a switch to rev-tree, which would turn it to rev-line ;-)?

Then, you could also easily implement support for passing additional
commit ID to git log, and it would then print out the range between
these two.

That would do exactly what you want, and would be probably quite usable
for other uses too.
