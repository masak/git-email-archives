David, I took your patch, updated it for some changes in diff-tree, and
then totally rewrote (and simplified) your testing for "interesting".
There was no reason to consider "/" special, as it falls out of the other
cases quite naturally.

It passes all the tests I threw at it, but they weren't exhaustive (but I 
do think I tested the border cases). Mind double-checking that it works 
for your cases too?
