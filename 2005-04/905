Linus,

I see you pulled the first two patches of my last series into your tree, 
so I know I had your attention briefly. I wanted to see what I can do to
help the rest of the changes get in, so....

I realized last night as I was going to bed that the third patch might 
not be accepted because it changes the behaviour slightly, nevermind that 
they were - by comparison with today's alternative - plain ugly.  

For what it's worth, init-db is practically useless for my package 
without the second change in this series.  Currently, I've implemented 
init-db in pure perl, but I'd like to use init-db.

As such, I started from scratch, and came up with a much simpler 
series of patches.  Please continue to ignore the previous series, but
consider these new patches in their stead.

New GIT_FILE_DIRECTORY patches will follow seperately.

Cheers,

Zach Welch
