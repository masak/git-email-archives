Btw, looking at curl's "getdate.c", it doesn't seem to be _that_ much more 
different from the date parsing we used to have. In particular, it 
actually uses "mktime()" twice and subtracts out the difference.

It also seems to do so in a particularly stupid way, and David Woodhouses 
suggestion of just using mktime() on Jan 1st, 1970, seems to be much 
simpler than what curl does.

(Actually, it might make sense to modify David's version to use "Jan 2nd,
1970" and subtract 24 hours, in case some mktime() implementation decides
that underflow is a problem...)

Of course, I think we might as well go with Edgars version after all. 

Edgar, willing to create a separate "parse-date.c" with your "my_mktime()" 
thing and move the old date parsing there? That way we'll just use that 
instead of libcurl..
