Indeed, handling block moves would definitely be *very* nice.  An ancient
version of darcs actually did this (it's not in the current darcs history,
since it was so ancient and buggy), although it had a terrible diff
algorithm.  But I really didn't understand the theory back then, and when I
rewrote everything, I never added the block moves back in.  They complicate
conflict situations a bit, and once I found that darcs was actually
useable, I started focusing on other issues.  (Most recently efficiency
issues.)
