The blob still has the same hash; therefore the file is still the same.
Nothing looks inside blobs; they just want either the hash or the full 
contents (if I understand the algorithms correctly).
I agree it's more code, but I think it can be nicely layered.

rsync uses a fixed chunk size, but this chunk can start at any offset (ie, 
not constrained to fixed boundaries).  This means that adding a single 
line to the file works like you'd expect, even though all the chunk 
boundaries change.  [I think this is what you're talking about.]

Not on (say) reiserfs, and not over the network.  I'm proposing (at the 
moment) easy conversion from chunked to unchunked disk representation,
so that you can leave things unchunked if (for example) you know you're 
running ext2 with a large block size.

Well, yes, it may be nontrivial.  But 'quite hard' depends on your 
perspective, I guess.  Given a cache of existing chunks, it's just a 
few table lookups. =)

So I guess I'll have to implement this and find out, won't I? =)
