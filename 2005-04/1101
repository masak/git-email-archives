ah, ok. I installed camlp4-3.08.3-1, and this also solved the other 
build problem as well that looked like to be a PATH problem.

when i run git-viz in a git-controlled directory, it seems to start up 
fine, but i get an error message: "Could not execute dot". Closing that 
window gives me the ability to do an 'Open', but git-viz does not seem 
to recognize any of my GIT repositories as such. (perhaps there's some 
GIT version dependency? I've got Linus' latest & greatest installed.)

fyi, it also didnt check for ocaml and lablgtk.
