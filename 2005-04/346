you are missing the point.

I'm not talking about takeing one document (sched.c) and finding a 
replacement that can drop in without being noticed.

what I'm talking about is the chance that somewhere, sometime there will 
be two different documents that end up with the same hash

what git is doing (in very crude sysadminish terms) is to take all the 
files you care about, move them into a new directory where they are named 
by their hash with a symlink that replaces the origional file (and then a 
bunch of stuff to manage multiple versions of those symlinks)

if you are taking every file that you ever care about and loosing all 
refrence to it except by it's hash then when you get a second file that 
has the same hash you loose the contents of one of the two files (race 
condition over which file gets written into the storage directory last)

anywhere else that hashing algorithms are used people realize that there 
will be hash collisions and plan accordingly, however people tend to put 
blinders on when you say SHA1 or MD5 and decide that somehow the same 
thing cannot happen with these types of hashes.

they can, and eventually they will so you need to plan accordingly.
