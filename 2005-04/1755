Petr's wrappers do all that head tracking OK (which is why I'm using a
combo of those and of lower-level gittiness).  They do handy remote repo
tracking too.

Hm.  For now I might try what I have plus Jan's fancy interdiff command to
remove duped patches.  We'll see.  I obtained a copy of Tony's ia64 diff
quite happily - it didn't have any duplicates.

(It's fairly common for two subsystem maintainers to apply the same patch. 
With bk I was resolving that by just smashing the patches on top of each
other, ignoring the rejects and refreshing the topmost patch.  That
approach actually resolved this linus-vs-davem dupe as well.  But the duped
patch was so damn BIG that it threw me.  And I wasn't feeling gitty enough
to go hunting about looking for the particular patch(es) which caused the
problem)
