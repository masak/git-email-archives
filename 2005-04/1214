I'd _really_ prefer to just try to teach people to work from the "top" 
directory instead.

I really don't like it that much, but to some degree it obviously is
exactly what "--prefix=" does to checkout-cache. It's basically saying 
that all normal file operations have to be prefixed with a magic string. 

And git really doesn't do too many of those, so maybe it's ok. What would 
the patch look like? I don't really love the idea, but if the patch is 
clean enough...
