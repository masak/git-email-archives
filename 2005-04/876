It is currently optimizing for the shortest longer path, but I guess it
should optimize for the shortest shorter path (i.e., the 0-length path
from A to itself always wins).

On the other hand, the date-based comparison (which you'd get with the
version I sent yesterday with [2/4] and [4/4]) would give you the most
recent common ancestor, which would necessarily avoid this situation.

Do you want to go with the date-based approach, or should I work out a 
shortest shorter path algorithm?
