The attached patch was seriously corrupt. Did you edit it by hand? The 
second chunk of the git-merge-one-file-script patch claims to have 12 
source lines, but only has 11, causing patch no end of confusion.

I fixed up the line counts by hand, and the end result looked almost sane,
but when looking closer, I noticed the

	+       if [ $ -ne 0 ]; then
	+               echo "ERROR: Leaving conflict merge in $src2"
	                exit 1

which just can't be right either ("$" never equals 0, so the above will 
always report an error), so I assume that whatever editing you did was 
really quite corrupt. Yeah, yeah, you obviously meant "$?", but the fact 
is, your patch is bogus, and I don't trust it. Can you re-send a valid one 
(and sign off on it).
