Fixed. I think. My solution is clever, but untested.

What I do is that instead of _removing_ the unmerged entries (which we 
can't do, or we'd later think that the file has gone away if we see that 
same name in the tree we're comparing against), I make all unmerged 
entries be in "stage 3".

Then, when we read in the tree to compare against into stage 1, we have a 
few cases:

 - stage 0 only: new file
 - stage 0 and 1: modified file
 - stage 1 only: deleted file
 - stage 1 and 3: unmerged
 - stage 3 only: unmerged

See any problems with this? (a mix of 0 and 3 cannot happen - a file is
either unmerged or it is ok, since inserting a stage 0 entry always
removes all unmerged entires).
