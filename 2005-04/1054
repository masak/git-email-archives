Hello!

Perhaps it's a naive question, but how do I switch between branches?  I
mean an equivalent of "svn switch" or "cvs update -r branch" that would
reuse the existing working directory.

I tried to switch a git-pasky working directory to the linus branch.

Here's what I tried:

git track linus
git cancel
git pull
git cancel
git merge linus
git cancel

After all that I found that README is still from the pasky branch.

Then I tried "git merge -b pasky linus" - this actually changed the
files to the linus branch, but it didn't remove files specific to
git-pasky.  Also, I'm surprised that I had to specify "-b pasky", as if
the currently checked out branch is unknown.

I'm using git-pasky 0.6.2.
