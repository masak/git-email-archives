Because this gives you more type control, and type control is good where
it makes sense (i.e. the types are completely orthogonal). It makes
sense here - either you _know_ your sha1 is of given type, or you don't
know at all what are you doing.

Also, when looking at an URI, you can immediately say what type of
object does it point at. I actually consider that a pretty important
property.
