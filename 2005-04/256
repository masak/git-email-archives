It seems like users won't expect there to be a new working directory for
the merge in which they are supposed to resolve te conflicts, but where
they don't see their uncommited changes. In any case, the low-level tools
have to care about *some* working directory, even if it isn't the parent
of .git, and the parent of .git seems like where other similar things
happen. If we're being conservative about merging, we're likely to report
a lot of conflicts, at least until we work out better techniques than a
simple 3-way merge.

Okay; I've currently got the one where the number of generations it is
away from the further head is the smallest, and of equal ones, an
arbitrary choice. If people are generally similar in the amount they
diverge before commiting, this should be the most similar ancestor.

I think we should be able to get good results out of doing the 5 merges
and reporting a conflict only if there's a conflict in all of them; it
shouldn't be possible for two to succeed but give different results (if it
did, clearly our current algorithm is unsafe, since it would give some
undesired output if it happened to use the wrong ancestor).

I'm thinking of not actually calling "merge(1)" for this at all; it just
calls diff3, and diff3 is only 1745 lines including option parsing. We can
probably arrange to look around for better ancestors in case of conflicts
we'd otherwise have to report, and get this all tidy and more efficient
than having diff3 re-read files. And if we only go to other ancestors in
case of conflicts, we're going to be a lot faster total than getting a
reaction from the user, almost no matter what we do.

I've got something like that (see above); did you want it in some form
other than the patch I sent you?
