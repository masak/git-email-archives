Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 19, 2005 at 09:04:16PM CEST, I got a letter
where David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> told me that...
> I don't love the 'require gitadd.pl' but it's a gradual start...

I hate it, for one. ;-)

> Cogito.pm seems to be a good place for the library stuff.

Sounds sensible.

> git.pl
> passes everything to scripts except gitadd.pl

We've decided to go for the individual scripts directly. :-)

Unfortunately, you didn't send the attachments inline, so I can't
comment on them sensibly.

Perhaps my main problem is now style. I'd prefer you do format it alike
the C sources of git, with 8-chars indentation and such. Also make sure
you use spaces around (or after) operators. Also, for just few short
functions I prefer putting the functions before the code itself.

> use IO::File;   # leads to less perlish syntax and is standard in perl dists

Oh come on. Are you writing Perl or not? I think it looks pretty awful,
and you are using Perl filehandle idioms anyway, so...
