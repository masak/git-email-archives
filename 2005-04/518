Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 17, 2005 at 06:51:59PM CEST, I got a letter
where Daniel Barkalow <barkalow@iabervon.org> told me that...

Note that during merge with Linus (probably the most complicated I've
got so far, but still thankfully not too painful thanks to the rej
tool) I've decided to revert your merge-base in favour of Linus'
version. I did this mainly to make me merging Linus less awful; we
should probably clean it up first and decide which solution to go for in
the first place before possibly replacing it again, I think.
