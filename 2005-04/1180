usually there are two interesting things about a patchset: how many 
lines does it change, and how many files. Patches that change lots of 
files (but change only a couple of lines in every file) have a 'large' 
scope.  Patches that change 1-2 files have a 'small' scope. A pure 
'number of lines changed' metric is useful too. Generally patches that 
have either a large linecount or a large scope are more interesting.  

(I'm not sure how this could be displayed - perhaps the size of the 
rectangle could vary to a certain degree? Perhaps the shape too?  
Something non-numeric, so that one gets immediate visual feedback.)

when the redrawing happens in the visible area then one can see how 
really slow it is: 100-200 msec per rectangle (!).

ah, ok. I guess it will start working once Petr's changes are merged 
into Linus' tree.
