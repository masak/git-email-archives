This is the way that darcs would currently represent a "darcs replace 
foo bar" on 15 files, which is obviously exactly what you are objecting to:
[global foo to bar
tupshin@tupshin.com**20050419155539] {
replace ./dir1/file1 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir1/file2 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir1/file3 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir1/file4 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir1/file5 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir2/file1 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir2/file2 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir2/file3 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir2/file4 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir2/file5 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir3/file1 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir3/file2 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir3/file3 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir3/file4 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir3/file5 [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
}

I see two possible complementary ways to address this:
1) allow something akin to the above form in git free-form comments as a 
*technical* solution, while leaving it up to the individual repository 
owner whether to accept such patches on aesthetic grounds.
2) explore adding a different format to darcs that would allow a files 
affected to be represented more compactly.


I suspect that any use of wildcards in a new format would be impossible 
for darcs since it wouldn't allow darcs to construct dependencies, 
though I'll leave it to david to respond to that.

At a minimum, something like:
replace ./dir1/[file1|file2|file3|file4|file5] [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir2/[file1|file2|file3|file4|file5] [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
replace ./dir3/[file1|file2|file3|file4|file5] [A-Za-z_0-9] foo bar
should be pretty feasible.

I don't believe, however, that it would ever be 100% reliable to try to 
look at a one line replace description and combine it with the actual 
changes and end up with a correct darcs replace patch.
