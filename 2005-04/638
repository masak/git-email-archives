Nothing beats backups and distribution. The distributed nature of git 
means that you can replicate your objects abitrarily.

Run "fsck-cache". It not only tests SHA1 and general object sanity, but it
does full tracking of the resulting reachability and everything else. It
prints out any corruption it finds (missing or bad objects), and if you
use the "--unreachable" flag it will also print out objects that exist but 
that aren't readable from any of the HEAD nodes (which you need to 
specify).

So for example

	fsck-cache --unreachable $(cat .git/HEAD)

will do quite a _lot_ of verification on the tree. There are a few extra 
validity tests I'm going to add (make sure that tree objects are sorted 
properly etc), but on the whole if "fsck-cache" is happy, you do have a 
valid tree.

Any corrupt objects you will have to find in backups or other archives (ie
you can just remove them and do an "rsync" with some other site in the
hopes that somebody else has the object you have corrupted).

Of course, "valid tree" doesn't mean that it wasn't generated by some evil 
person, and the end result might be crap. Git is a revision tracking 
system, not a quality assurance system ;)
