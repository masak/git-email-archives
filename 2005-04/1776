Thanks for writing that! :-)

I'd vote for describing the cg-update right near cg-pull, or perhaps
even before cg-update, as the primary method; I think it's commonly what
people really want to do when they do cg-pull anyway.

cg-merge is _not_ like doing cg-diff | cg-patch - that's a dangerous
thought, and not true at all. cg-diff | cg-patch will just apply the
given diff to your working directory, but it won't record any merging
metadata, will often get it very wrong, and you will get to all sorts of
other troubles. Just always use cg-merge. And probably pass it -b only
when you know what are you doing.

Thanks,
