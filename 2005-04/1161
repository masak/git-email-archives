Thanks !

It has to call `cat-file commit' for each commit id to get the author
... it's just that's a lot of forks.

That's interesting. What do you mean exactly by scope ?

Right, it is slow. From what I could understand with a bit of
profiling, the problem is with the "text" canvas item for the boxes'
labels. I guess libgnomecanvas isn't using Pango properly or
something: it lookups the font with fontconfig each time I create such
an item. I'm not sure what I can do about this.

Also, there's a -noaa option that draws an non-antialiased canvas :
it's noticeably faster (and uglier too).

Yes, this message must come from one of the libraries (libart most
probably)

It works with Petr Baudis' git-pasky (it calls `git diff'). I don't
know how to do that with the canonical git.

Thanks for the suggestions,
