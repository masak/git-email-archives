This actually came all the way from git-merge-one-file-script.

I don't think the intermediate stage matters at all, actually; from the
user's point of view it is nearly instantenous, and the tree keeps
changing during the merge anyway, when you are trying to resolve
non-exact merges by the merge utility. From the user's point of view,
the act of merging is atomic and you always end up with something
consistent, unless cg-merge is killed. But in that case it's all messed
up anyway and you'll better just cg-cancel and try again.
