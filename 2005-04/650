Dear diary, on Mon, Apr 18, 2005 at 05:23:34PM CEST, I got a letter
where Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com> told me that...

Yes, sorry about that; I had a lot of mail traffic lately and I'm not so
used to it. ;-)

Resend from scratch, please.

I cannot guarantee I will look at it immediately, though. Optimizing is
nice, but gitdiff-do's speed is already usable and there are much more
pressing issues for git-pasky right now.

Instead of the previous patch. But what I said still holds - this can go
in only after we have a shell library sharing the common functions - I
don't want to have this horrid stuff in every file.

Actually, if you will make a mktemp shell function, no changes
whatsoever might be needed to the other scripts.
