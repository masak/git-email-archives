Dear diary, on Wed, Apr 20, 2005 at 10:56:33PM CEST, I got a letter
where Petr Baudis <pasky@ucw.cz> told me that...

Note that what you will probably do _most_ by far is cg update.
You generally do cg pull only when you want to make sure you have the
latest and greatest when doing some cg diff or whatever, or on your
notebook when getting on an airplane. And you do direct cg merge generally
only on the airplane.

I also forgot one last usage change:

  cg fork BNAME BRANCH_DIR [COMMIT_ID]
  ->
  cg fork BRANCH_DIR [BNAME] [COMMIT_ID]

This will bring its usage in sync to both cg export and cg tag.
The branch name will also default to the last element in the
BRANCH_DIR path (that annoyed me a lot, basically writing a thing
two times at single line).
