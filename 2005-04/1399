Great. So what have you done here? Suppose you have 32 bits of counter
for n. Whoopee, you just added 32 bits to your hash, using a two stage
algorithm. So, you have a 192 bit hash assuming you started with the 160
bit SHA. And, one day your 32 bit counter won't be enough. Then what?

You aren't solving anything. You're just putting it off, and doing it in
a way that breaks all the wonderful semantics possible by just assuming
that the hash is unique. All of a sudden we are doing checks of data
that we never did before, and we have to do the check trillions of times
before the CPU time spent pays off.

If you want to use a bigger hash then use a bigger hash, but don't fool
yourself into thinking that isn't what you are doing.

Ciao,
