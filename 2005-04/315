It seems to me that you must be doing something wrong then. I can't see
anything which would not make ls-tree blindingly fast (except for when
being recursive, see below).

BTW, what do you need ls-tree output for, when doing export _to_ git?

P.S.: It seems that Linus applied a patch to ls-tree which will make it
read_sha1_file() on each item when ls-tree is recursive. Junio, why did
you do it? Is there any possible case when the item would not be marked
as directory but it would be a tree object? I could imagine it bogging
down ls-tree on big tree a lot.
