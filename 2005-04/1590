Linus, could you please suggest a suitable license statement to
include in whichever files of yours we choose to include in Darcs?  Is
David's suggestion (stock GPL boilerplate with ``or any later
version'' removed) okay with you?

> Any chance you can host a gettable repository?

The last tag in darcs-unstable is 1.0.0rc2, which prevents me from
publishing a partial repository in my web space.  Perhaps you could
pull a recent tag into darcs-unstable?

That would be great (let me know if you need an ssh public key).

I haven't thought about it yet.  Does anyone have any ideas about how
to efficiently pull from git without a complete local copy?

I'll reply to the more technical points below on darcs-devel -- no
point in spamming the kind folks on git@ any further, especially as
they probably know about
