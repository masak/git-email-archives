OK, sure.  But how 'bout chunking trees?  Are you grown happy with the new 
trees-reference-other-trees paradigm, or is there a deep longing in your 
heart for the simplicity of 'trees-reference-blobs-period'?  I'm fairly
certain that chunking could get you the space-savings you need without 
multi-level trees, if the simplicity of that is still appealing.

Not necessarily for rev.1 of the chunking code, but I'm curious as to 
whether it's still of interest at all.  I don't know exactly how far
ingrained multilevel trees have become since they were adopted.
