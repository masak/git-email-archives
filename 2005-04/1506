I wasn't. I don't think it's nearly as relevant for diff-cache, since 
diff-cache is never run thousands of times.

IOW, with diff-cache you can just do

	diff-cache <tree> | grep "interesting"

and you're done.

Diff-tree is different, simply because diff-tree is the way you find out
which files changed between two revisions, so if you search for "when did
this file change" you may well have to do _thousands_ of different
diff-tree's. That's why pruning the diff-tree output is important: it
makes diff-tree _much_ cheaper.

diff-cache usually doesn't make sense to do against more than one or two
threes (the parent, and after a merge but before you commit maybe the
parent_s_).
