Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 24, 2005 at 03:35:08AM CEST, I got a letter
where Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org> told me that...

Hi,

you might want to try again with cogito-0.8; I hope I simplified the
concepts a lot.

There is no tracking, and branches are trivial - branches correspond to
repositories. When you do cg-init <remoterepo>, you get a branch origin
which represents the remoterepo (and gets updated when you do cg-pull or
cg-update), you can make Cogito know of more remote repositories by
doing cg-branch-add.


Yes, the README sucks; but apparently it helps at least some people. ;-)
