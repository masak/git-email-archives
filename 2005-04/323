We can just have a baseline file contain all the commit objects.
Then have the git "download on demand". The problem with diff
package  is that I it is harder to merge with more than one diff.

I bet 90% of the time people sync to the repository head first
want to check out the last bits. And maybe reading some change
log to see what is changed.

So having all the commit object, the user will able to see
what is change and which version he we like to check out.

Then he can issue a command "download me all the objects is needed
for checkout the this commit". Download of demand should be
even better.
