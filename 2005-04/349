Hi Linus et al.,

I'm trying to use git, but I frequenty run into problems with file permissions
-- some archives (including the master git archive) contain group-writable
files, but when I check them out, the permissions get trimmed by my umask
(quite sensibly) and update-cache complains that they need update.

Does it really make sense to store full permissions in the trees? I think
that remembering the x-bit should be good enough for almost all purposes
and the other permissions should be left to the local environment.

Another possibility is to keep the permissions in the trees, but just make
update-cache ignore differences in write permissions.

				Have a nice fortnight
