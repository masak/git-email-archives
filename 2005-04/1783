No, you've missed the point. It isn't the size of the change what
matters - cg-patch should handle even huge patches (mostly) fine.  What
matters is that you just did was not merge. It was applying some patch
to your working tree, but not merging branches.

So after doing cg-diff | cg-patch several times, you have your working
tree full of huge local changes (making it impossible to sensibly
cg-merge) and your last commit happenned long ago. Or you commit the
cg-patch results, but your commits are wrong, since they don't carry the
appropriate merge information.
