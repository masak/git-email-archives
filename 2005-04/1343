I was initially inclined to agree with Jan, but on brief reflection I
think Christian is correct to want to preserve the type info in the
URI. There are numerous reasons why this is a good idea:

- both carbon and silicon users of the URI who don't have direct
access to the repository can infer what the URI refers to without
actually fetching it

- programmatically the web server can make request routing decisions
based on the URI alone and is not forced to perfom a relatively
expensive and unnecessary db hit to derive the type.

That said, I can see some value in providing a web-based
type-resolution service.

So, given a URI of the form

     /<project>/object/<hexadecimal sha1 representation>

the server should resolve the type of the named object and issue an
HTTP re-direct to the typed URI, e.g.

     /<project>/blob/<hexadecimal sha1 representation>

Because browsers tend not to remember redirection sources, external
entities end up recording the typed URIs, but all the benefits of
Jan's suggestion still accrue.
