I think that one reason why rsync is inefficient for git is that it 
appears to need an acknowledgement after every file. (at least, that's 
what what the rhythm of the packets looked like when I sniffed it 
earlier, I don't know anything else about it) For a series of very small 
files this interacts badly with tcp's flow control mechanisms. Perhaps 
rsync could be modified for a "sliding file acknowledgement window".

Most "swarming protocols" (e.g BitTorrent, eDonkey) work well for one 
big file shared among multiple hosts, but poorly for lots of small files.

*Nothing* out there matches the simplicity of git's sha1 filename 
length... but

Something like robcast or fcast/flute might be of interest:

http://www.inrialpes.fr/planete/people/roca/mcl/mcl_in_short.html

Or one of the multicast netnews experiments:

"mcntp" http://mcntp.sourceforge.net/
"newscaster" http://www.dmn.tzi.org/en/newscaster.html

lastly, Monotone has it's own "netsync" protocol
(via http://www.venge.net/monotone/faq.html)

"[netsync] is a bi-directional pipelined protocol for synchronizing 
collections using a tree of hashed indices. It allows any copy of 
monotone to function as either a client or a server, and rapidly 
synchronize or half-synchronize (push / pull) their database with 
another user. It is somewhat similar in flavor to rsync or Unison, in 
that it quickly and idempotently synchronizes information across the 
network without needing to store any local state; however, it is much 
more efficient than these protocols."
