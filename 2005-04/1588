Very cool! :)

First off, you need to include a license header in the git files indicating
that unlike the rest of darcs, they may only be distributed under GPL v2.
Something like the following would probably be fine (but it's Linus'
copyright that's involved, not mine)

Without this header, it's either illegal to distribute these files, or
they're assumed to be under GPLv2 or later along with the rest of darcs,
which also isn't legal...

Any chance you can host a gettable repository? If not, I'd be happy to give
you an account on darcs.net on which you could host darcs-git.

There is a conflict in GNUMakefile, which is moderately easy to resolve.
It would be nice to keep files in alphabetical order (as is mostly
currently the case, which has some small chance of reducing the likelihood
of conflicts.

Or alternatively run "autoconf; ./configure; make"

Do you have any plans/ideas for allowing pulls directly from a remote git
repository? Obviously it'll be less efficient, since you'll have to
download at least one file in its entirety.  Perhaps we could store a git
mirror in _darcs and use rsync?  :(

Those two look fine to me.  I'm increasingly liking (as I get to understand
it better) your ideas regarding modularizing repository access.

Okay, it does look like most of your code will be equally useful for the
"tagging like crazy" scheme.

We certainly can discuss it, and I still object.  I think it'd be much
better to map from git commits to darcs patch ids.  Your scheme and mine
both have uglinesses.

My "tag like crazy" scheme gives a unique mapping of a git commit to one
darcs patch and one darcs tag, but has the ugliness that a darcs patch
can't be mapped to a git commit without adding an additional darcs tag.  I
tend to see this as a plus.  It reflects the fact semantic difference
between a darcs patch and a git commit--the git commit is actually
equivalent not to a darcs patch but rather a darcs tag.

Your idea has the niceness that it could provide a one-to-one (as opposed
to two-to-one) mapping between darcs patches and git commits, but the catch
is that we don't know the git commit ID until after the patch has been
moved into git-land.  This is directly analagous to the wart in my scheme
that darcs patches would acquire a tag when moved into git-land.  I prefer
my scheme, since extra tags are relatively harmless, and reflect the
dependencies in the git repository.

All right.  I'll look forward to another installment after next weekend
then!  :)

I had a few minor comments on your code, which I've forgotten.  One was
that either you're compiling with ghc 6.2, or you've disabled
-Werror... It'd be nice to be sure that your code is -Werror-clean with ghc
6.4 as well.
