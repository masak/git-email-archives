I was actually digressing and talking about pruning ancient history
which _is_ theoretically reachable. It's not being 'undone'; it's just
being omitted from the current _working_ tree. The whole point is that
in a fully-populated tree the history _should_ be accessible all the way
back.

We're trying to get the older history available on kernel.org ASAP. The
blobs are rsyncing to ~dwmw2/git/kernel-tglx1; the trees and commit
objects will be coming soon. 

Theoretically all Linus actually needs in order to rebuild his current
tree is the sha1 hash of the final commit in that historical tree, which
corresponds to 2.6.12-rc2.
