I would _heartily_ recommend moving towards UTF-8 as the
internal charset for all comments.  Alternatives are possible
(e.g., recording the charset in the header), but they're
incredibly messy.  Even if you don't normally work in UTF-8,
it's pretty easy to set most editors up to read & write UTF-8.
Having the data stored as a constant charset eliminates
a raft of error-prone code.
