Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 24, 2005 at 01:20:21AM CEST, I got a letter
where Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@pobox.com> told me that...

It's highly unlikely you would get a _single_ collision.

*sigh*

We've been through this before, haven't we?

No, a collision is pretty common thing, actually. It's the main power of
git, actually - when you do read-tree, modify it and do write-tree
(typically when doing commit), everything you didn't modify (99% of
stuff, most likely) is basically a collision - but it's ok since it
just stays the same.
