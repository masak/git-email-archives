Nope, daylight savings time breaks this, since you may or may not be in
the same time zone on January 1st as you are at the current time.

However, you don't need to count leap seconds when you implement your own
mktime, since mktime doesn't have to take leap seconds into account.  Unix
timestamps, unless you're using TAI, don't include leap seconds.
