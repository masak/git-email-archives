Dear diary, on Fri, Apr 15, 2005 at 11:28:38AM CEST, I got a letter
where Martin Schlemmer <azarah@nosferatu.za.org> told me that...

Thanks for the merge and typo fixes. I can't imagine how, but it really
appeared to work for me that time!

I'm confused however what does the exits_in_cache() (what exits? exists?)
gives us, apart of horribly-looking code. What bug does it fix?

Thanks,
