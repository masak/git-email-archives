This series contains three patches to add functionality to the library
routines necessary for the rest of the series, a patch to change the
merge-base implementation such that it always returns one of its arguments
when possible (by way of using the date-based algorithm), and a patch to
support fetching what is needed from a repository by HTTP, and both
pushing and pulling by ssh.

 1: Add some functions for commit lists
 2: Parse tree objects completely
 3: Add some functions related to files
 4: Replace merge-base
 5: Add push and pull programs
