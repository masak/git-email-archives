You really don't. With git, the only thing you need is one object store,
and some way to _track_ those 30-40 separate git trees (and "track" really
means "remember a single SHA1 name for their top-of-tree").

Then you can merge any combination of the 40 in the same tree. 

You'll get confused easily, but if you do this all with tools, it 
shouldn't be too bad.

Well, git isn't as good at merging as BK is, and your usage sure as hell
would be a horrible worst-case example, but it might actually work fine.  
Git merges are _cheap_ (with a capital C, and probably H as well) when
they work out, and quite frankly, so far they have always worked out for
me.

But yeah, you'd be doing some pretty aggressive merging, using a tool that 
is two weeks old. It might work. I'd be interested to know ;)
