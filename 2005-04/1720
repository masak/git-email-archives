Hello!

My patch for Makefile was misapplied, so installed commit-id is still
needed for "make" to succeed.

Shell commands are processed by make before being passed to the shell,
and $(...) is expanded by make before new PATH is set, as it is done in
the current Makefile.

Also, the dependency on commit-id was dropped from my patch for some
reason.  I believe it's still needed.  Also, we need a dependency on
cat-file, which is used by commit-id internally.
