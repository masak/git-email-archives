Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 19, 2005 at 02:36:32PM CEST, I got a letter
where Klaus Robert Suetterlin <robert@mpe.mpg.de> told me that...

There is git and git-pasky (git-pasky is superset; therefore various
patches floating around either get to git-pasky or to both). I'm not
sure what else do you mean.

I don't think it's evil at all. Why should it?

It's stabilizing. Mind you, it's 2 weeks old.

Have you read the README? If you have any questions, go ahead and ask.
_Write_ the description if you miss it.

Patches welcome.

I think the way to go now that it's working and we are to add some sweet
cream on it is to rewrite it in Perl. I have some parts in progress
already.

You couldn't. UTSL now and write the docs and the testcases, or wait a
while.

"Someone"?

Again, patches welcome. The patches are likely usually no big deal now,
though. I'm by all means for fixing them, especially when git will start
to head towards libgit.
