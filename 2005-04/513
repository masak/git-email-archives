sed works as well - in fact, we can use it to both select lines based
upon the :1 _and_ cut out the bulk of the stuff we're not interested in.
So:

rev-tree $to $prev | \
  sort -nr | cut -d' ' -f2 | grep :1 | cut -d: -f1

becomes:

rev-tree $to $prev | \
  sed -n 's,\([[:digit:]]\+\)[[:space:]]\+\([[:xdigit:]]\+\):1.*,\1 \2,p' | \
  sort -nr | cut -d' ' -f2

(appologies to those who don't like regexps 8))

One thing to note about that sed expression though - using \+ is a GNU
extension - do we care about that?  The portable way is to use \{1,\}
but that'd clutter it some more.
