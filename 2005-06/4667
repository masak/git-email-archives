Dear diary, on Tue, Jun 07, 2005 at 11:59:36AM CEST, I got a letter

Hmm, then why not make it --wrt-author[=AUTHOR] ? Similar to the
--pretty option. BTW, can it do multiple author excludes now? The
commandline would look especially horrifying in that case now, I guess.

I'd prefer --stop-at-author from the choices you offer in your other
mail.

Yes, such motivation makes sense. But is the author field the right one?
If you are integrating a lot of other people's patches in particular, I
think it makes no sense whatsoever - you already reviewed and
consciously applied them, but your option will regard them as something
alien and merged from outside, right?

And, after all, the other branches might be _quite_ long-lived. I think
it would be confusing for the user if the commit graph looked like

  a1 -- a2 -- a3 -- a4 -- a5 -- a6 -- a7 -- a8 -- a9 -- a10
     \           /           /     \                 /
      - b1 -- b2 -- b3 -- b4 -- b5 -- b6 -- b7 -- b8 -- b9

If your patch first chooses b1, it then shows all of it, completely
ignoring a2, right? I can't see how that would be right - the subsequent
merges from a should be shown.
