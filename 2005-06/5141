Makes a lot of sense.  Looking at the repo, I did indeed forget to copy 
the tags.

Ref email just sent:  Kernel hackers expect tags to come with the pull. 
  Four kernel hackers, and counting.

Just accept that our brains are wired that way ;-)  We like having 
Linus-blessed-and-pushed-to-kernel.org tags from linux-2.6.git public 
tree follow us around.

	git-pull-script --tags $url

should accomplish that.
