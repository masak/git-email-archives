My main dislike about that was that I don't think -S is "better" than
annotate as you claim - I think it's different and can be better in many
circumstances, but I don't like the notion of telling a new user "you
don't want annotate, pickaxe is better".

Let's just be upfront about some things being missing, and suggest
alternatives. A lot of times, just "git-whatchanged -p filename" ends up
being sufficient, at other times -S might be.

Finally, please send it as a patch, that way the authorship etc stuff gets 
done right.

Does anybody have any suggestions? Preferably with a reasonable 
test-case, so that people can try it out.. Maybe just leaving the merge 
failures where they are?
