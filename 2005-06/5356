Oh come on, stop the FUD.   You pack all the objects up into a single pack
file (see new feature in Git) and you burn it _once_ to dvd or cdrom.

Git is still developing, there will be new ways to seek and cache things
etc eventually that remove any performance issue.  Git gets this right, it
concentrates on what is important, stays flexible and trusts that down the
road as things mature any performance problems can be dealt with.

It already has some tools that are better than BK ever had (gitk, gitweb,
etc..)

Cheers,
