No, it _is_ a constant factor even in number of files, if you just keep 
the pack objects around without re-packing them.

Basically, you'd get one new pack-file every time I push. That's better
than getting <n> "raw object" files (where <n> can be anything from just a
couple to several thousand, depending on whether I had pulled things), but
it's still just a constant factor on both number of files and size of
files.

Now, you could re-pack the objects every once in a while: it would force a
whole new "epoch", of course and then the mirrorers would have to fetch
the whole repacked file, but that might be fine. Especially if you stop
re-packing after you've hit a certain size (say, a couple of megs), and
then start on the next pack.

Actually, it won't be "quick" - it will have to read the whole file and do 
it's hash window thing.

You _could_ append the pack-files into one single "superpack" file (since
you can figure out where the pack boundaries are), but it would be
extremely big after a while, and rsync would spend all its time doing over
the hash window. You'd definitely be better off with re-packing.
