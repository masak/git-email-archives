Yes. Now that read-tree verifies that the working directory is clean (at
least for any non-identity files), it's a non-issue.

Well, without "-u" you should see the old "order doesn't matter" case, but
yes, the theory is that the three trees are <base> <current> <merge> for
the three-way case, and <current> <new> for the two-way one.

You can get the old behaviour by using

	git-read-tree -m <cur>
	git-read-tree -m <base> <cur> <merge>

where the first read-tree ends up just makign sure that the index file 
matches the current head (use "-u" or not as you like).

(Side note: the actual read-tree phase should be totally agnostic about 
whether the current tree is the first, second or third of the trees, since 
it will happily say "oh, we saw this exact directory entry in _one_ of the 
trees, so we know it hasn't gotten lost".  So for now, order still is left 
to the final user, but I don't think you should depend on that).
