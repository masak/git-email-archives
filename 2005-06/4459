Dear diary, on Thu, Jun 02, 2005 at 12:00:55AM CEST, I got a letter
where Daniel Barkalow <barkalow@iabervon.org> told me that...

Was that the patch I was replying to recently? It didn't seem to have
any dependencies.

I would like to have this a lot too. Pulling tags now is a PITA, and I
definitively want to go in this way. So it will land at least in git-pb.
:-) (But that's a little troublesome if you say it's incompatible
change.)
