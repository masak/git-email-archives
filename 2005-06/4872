Right, cherry picking and history don't go well together--which is why
darcs doesn't normally store a real history (although it can do so--you
just can't keep certain portions of the history unless you accept the
patches involved).

There are also issues in defining the intersection of all patches.  Ideally
if you take the union of that intersection with one of the original
repositories, you'd get that same repository back, but most naive
implementations of union/intersection won't have that property, which would
lead to confusion and inconvenience.

This sort of workflow would actually be pretty easy to implement in darcs,
if someone were interested.

I think the biggest issue would be the one mentioned about the problems
with a single lazy developer.  But I think rather than some sort of
majority rule (or "if three developers think it's okay, then it's okay"),
keeping the number of relevant developers down would make sense.  This also
makes sense in that unless you've got seriously dedicated developers, you
don't want to force everyone to read every patch.  I think if you went with
a system like this and wanted many maintainers involved, it would probably
best to organize things hierarchically.
