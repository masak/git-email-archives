Well, the real solution is to use a git-aware protocol, not rsync.

rsync is wonderful for prototyping, and I wanted to make the database 
rsync'able for that reason, but it clearly doesn't scale.

I think I'll make a "pack"/"unpack" pair that just packs all the necessary
objects between two commits. Then you can basically sync the object file 
by doing

	git-pack OLD..NEW | ssh other-end git-unpack

and you'd basically be done. It looks pretty easy to do, too..
