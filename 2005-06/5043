Btw, if possibly, you should just undo it. It's "valid" in the sense that
having the same parent duplicated will just be considered to be a merge by
a paritcularly strange person, but it's definitely not good practice, and
since it _is_ technically a merge, programs that avoid showing merges
(like "git-whatchanged" - because it doesn't know what it should show as 
the "difference") won't show it.

Other programs, like "git-diff-tree -m", which show _all_ sides of a 
merge, will show the diff twice (because it shows the diff against all 
parents). Which is also why you see it twice in your git-changes-script.

Again, "git commit" _did_ warn about this, I'm sure, but I actually see 
why that stupid MERGE_HEAD file was there - a null merge won't remove a 
stale MERGE_HEAD, so it's probably because you did a "git pull" that was a 
trivial merge, and that would have left that turd around..
