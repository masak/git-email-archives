I don't think locking for the duration of the push really is a problem.
It is unlikely that there would be so many people pushing that it would
cause inconvenience... Of course it would be nice to optimize it if
possible.

I would assume the biggest problem for most people is how they can push
through a firewall. From that point of view it would make sense to do
the push as a cgi script rather than something over ssh. And with a
cgi script you can of course optimize the locking and use tmp files
before renaming which are a bit hard to do with rsync.
