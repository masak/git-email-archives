You are right. I will do this for the next release (0.2, probably of
the end of this week), something like the tree structure below:

.git/refs/bases/<head>
.git/series/<head>/
.git/series/<head>/applied
.git/series/<head>/unapplied
.git/series/<head>/current
.git/series/<head>/patches/*

I don't know whether a git-diff-* command would look into
.git/refs/bases (I can do this in stgit but, this was only for
convenience).

You can cherry-pick the second patch by first commuting it with the
previous patches. If they are independent, the commuting via diff3
wouldn't generate any conflict. Even with the current stgit, you can
pop all the patches and only push those to be merged upstream. HEAD
would only contain the those patches.

If you want to implement a full-featured patch treacking, you might
end up with something like darcs which doesn't scale to the size of
the Linux kernel. On the other hand, you might not agree with the
changes to your accepted patch and a conflict is welcomed so that you
can choose whether to keep the old version or not.

Do you mean creating a new git type like the blob, tree or commit? I
would prefer not to modify git or have my own version of git. StGIT
should be a tool running directly on top of an existing installation
of git.

Instead of having a directory for every patch (with bottom, top
etc. files), I could create a git blob to store this information and
the series files (applied/unapplied files) would only contain the blob
id. This could simplify things if, in a future version, stgit would
allow patch cherry-picking.
