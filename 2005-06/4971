Fair enough... the reason I suggested it is that I use gitk to help me
decide how to merge stuff with the mainline. Currently I have to cut
and paste the ids of the "interesting" commits into the command line.
It would be nice to be able to point directly to an interesting commit
and tag it so that I can later get to it from a command line using a
name I can remember.

Still, I can quite accept that I have an idiosyncratic way of
interacting with git and gitk.
