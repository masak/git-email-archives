Dear diary, on Sun, Jun 05, 2005 at 05:30:53PM CEST, I got a letter
where Zack Brown <zbrown@tumblerings.org> told me that...
> Hi,

Hello,

> I've been tracking Cogito. This problem occurred with Cogito version
> 1e2673d606dd39dc44b4eed2204ba349a448bc4d
> 
> I have a directory tree with several layers of subdirectories and about 1700

> 
> The first thing I noticed was that not all the files and subdirectories had been

> I tried adding these files with "cg-add */*", "cg-add */*/*" etc, followed by

what are the files it would refuse to add?
