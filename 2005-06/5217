There's another option, which I may be the only person currently
using: have a repo (.git directory) not in a working directory, and have
the objects/ and refs/ subdirectories of the .git directories in your
working directories symlinked to those subdirectories of the repo. Then
you can have any number of functionally identical working directories,
each of which is set to some branch. If you have a reasonably small number
of branches at any time, they can each have a working directory switched
to them. On the other hand, all of the branches are accessible from any of
them.
