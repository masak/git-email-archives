> there is no way to modify the log history.

Aha.  If that means what I think it does, then I suspect I will remain
with quilt.  The per-patch comment is often about the last thing that
I put in the patch.

The special thing about quilt is that the patch set in every regard
is infinitely changeable - the selection and order of the patches,
the contents of the patches, and the comments and metadata associated
with the patch can all be edited trivially.

Quilt is not a change management system; it's a patch set composition
system.

That stgit is layered on git (a persistent data store), and that
it has something (the log history you mention above) that cannot
be modified, suggests that stgit is not a 'better quilt for git',
but some other sort of tool.

Good luck ;).
