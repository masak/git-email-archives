The kernel.org boxes got the new git-binaries installed yesterday, so I've
updated gitweb.cgi:

The cgi itself is available here:
  ftp://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/gitweb/

Along with a few cosmetical changes, it:

o shows renames:
    http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=git/git.git;a=commit;h=418aaf847a8b3ffffb4f777a2dd5262ca5ce0ef7

o strips the merge messages down, that they actually readable the commit title
  Thanks to Tony Luck for the hint.

o has new RSS feed format, that hopefully prints the commit in the right
  format while still be valid XML
  Thanks to Jan Blunck for the patch and testing.

o shows now the right 8-space tab indentation for for the blob and diffs.
  Thanks to Matthijs Melchior for his help fixing it.

o has the  diff-link in the history renamed to "diff to current"
  this hopefully makes the intended behavior more obvious
  Thanks to Sean.

o has a link for a text/plain view of files and diffs

o does not use the old environment variables anymore

Best,
Kay
