Wow -- I'll be tracking your tree closely then ;-)

I had that strategy in my back-pocket already, but it doesn't sound right.

Sounds like I'll be reading up on quilt then. I guess that's what I
was looking for...

Fair enough -- and actually I'm not convinced it's a horrible thing.
Having worked with forever-diverging tools like Arch, I can appreciate
the value of crystallizing and identifying when you've converged --
and rebasing all steps forward on the fact that you've converged. This
is huge.

A patch-based workflow is needed in the periphery of HEAD -- but
patch-based tools fail to see when they've converged. What I am
salivating about is the idea of some basic patch smarts based on
git/cogito that I can use to track things in simplistic scenarios.
Right now as soon as I'm one patch "off" all of git support breaks
down and it's really hard to keep merging forward. Unless I merge &
reverse as discussed.

Yup. And quilt or other tools in the periphery. Something like the
git-aware darcs (which I haven't looked at yet).

Agreed. I'm happy to roll out some custom perl scripts around git (or
extend cogito a bit) if git can expose some stable holding points for
external tools to try and do some lightweight patch tracking.

> Whether the kernel model is applicable to anything else, I dunno.

I don't know either -- but I'm sure the toolset around git can support
a range of dev models. I don't think any other project has such a
large pool and strong convergence dynamics as the kernel. But git and
its tools and practices can be (I'm hoping) quite flexible to support
a range of dev models.

cheers,
