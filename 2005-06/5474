The bulk of the cost in doing the hashing comes from having to read the 
file.

Well, if you grow a single pack file with appending, then you can have 
delta references to earlier objects within the same pack file.

At least at this point, we'd handle a few very large files a lot better 
than an enormous swarm of smaller ones.

In the end, it might be that the right thing to do for git on kernel.org 
is to have a single, unified object store which isn't accessible by 
anything other than git-specific protocols.  There would have to be some 
way of dealing with, for example, conflicting tags that apply to 
different repositories, though.
