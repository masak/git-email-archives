If each patch is given an ID by the author (not committer) which is
preserved across various later modifications, we could at least recognize
which patch it was. Then we could present the author with the information
that the patch was accepted and was modified, and give the author the
option of replacing it in the series with one that reverts some or all of
the modifications (including re-adding dropped portions). I don't see any
reason that it would be better to search for similarity rather than just
having things explicitly tagged (I think, although I'm not sure, that
authors will care about the difference between someone applying an
alternative patch and someone applying the author's patch with
modifications.
