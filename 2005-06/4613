I was more thinking of all the individual cases, and also the 2-way merge
issue (which _should_ be a lot easier, but hey, I had tons of bugs there
too).

For example, what should happen if you do a merge and you have a file in
the index that isn't mentioned by any of the trees involved. I consider 
that a failure, since the merge will remove the file, and since it wasn't 
committed, it's now a "data lost" issue. But did I actually get it right? 
I have no idea.
