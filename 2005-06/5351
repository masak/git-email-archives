And is exactly the wrong way around. Even RCS stored the _last_ version and
differences to earlier ones (you'll normally want the last one (or
something near), and so occasionally having to reconstruct earlier ones by
going back isn't a big deal; having to build up the current version by
starting from /dev/null and applying each and every patch that ever touched
the file each time is expensive given enough history, besides that any
error in the file is guaranteed to destroy the current version, not
(hopefully) just making old versions unavailable).  It also means that
losing old history (what you'll want to do once in a while, e.g. forget
everything before 2.8) is simple: Chop off at the right point.
