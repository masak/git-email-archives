Yes. The reasoning was that people wanting more features probably will 
use color as well (and I didn't want to force the pager on people who 
use cg-diff just to check *if* something changed).

But I'm not 100% convinced I'm doing the right thing. Any suggestions?

Yeah, maybe :-) Seriously, I think author date carries more information, 
particularly since the log is already (most of the time) ordered by 
commit date. So, when you see an old date before a newer one, you 
immediately know that some old stuff was incorporated into the repository.

Also, git-rev-list --pretty uses author date, and I wanted to be consistent.

Of course, I could always add one more option :-)

This is also a matter of taste, obviously. I actually *like* having two 
different formats, as it makes the difference between "today" and 
"earlier" more obvious. And I don't really care what time of day 
something was written three weeks ago.

Perhaps this should be customisable as well, if it's felt to be 
important enough?

"export LESS=-G" will do what you want. Maybe that should be the default?

That should already be there. "COGITO_COLORS='header=31' cg-log" should 
give very red headers, for example.

Good idea.

Yeah, I know. "-h" and "--help" are the only options not handled by 
optparse in cg-log. I thought I could rely on the general help-finding 
logic in cg-Xlib for that.

On the other hand, you really shouldn't say "cg-log -sh" :-)
