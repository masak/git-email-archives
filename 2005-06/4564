I haven't used recent Cogito, so I'm not sure, but it might actually want
git-rpush rather than cg-rpush? Or it might be a permissions issue?

I haven't made it understand port numbers yet; it should be pretty easy,
though, if you want to do it. You'd probably have a better chance of
getting it right than I would, if you've got an SSH server on a
non-default port to test against. Just parse out the part of "host" after
the : and make it a "-p" option in the execlp in rsh.c.
