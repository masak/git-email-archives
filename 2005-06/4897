And you get lots of nonsense in the new file.

And funny as it is, when the hole is found you're busted. Or at least
the first person responsible.
You probably couldn't shadow yourself enough not to get caught.

Which mean that you can't change your name on the project. See above.

If you can splice into the connection, you can put there anything you want,
including another kernel and any amount of exploits. Even with SSH.
Ever heard of man-in-the-middle attacks?

With high-grade security you won't be able to splice into the connection,
as it'll be fully encrypted (with HTH key exchange) and/or randomised using things like EFF's Tor.
Then they can check with kernel.org or any other mirror.

And they're so unforseeing that they don't check the sources of the
drivers they use.
Funny. And if they don't use it, you'll have a problem with enabling
your exploit.
Your best target would be a scheduler, but that's heavily scrutinised.

It is in theory. Tell someone when you mount such an attack on anybody.
