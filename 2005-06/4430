Dear diary, on Sun, May 29, 2005 at 11:41:23PM CEST, I got a letter
where Michael Frank <msfrank@syntaxjockey.com> told me that...

FWIW, I think this is the wrong approach - full-blown pushing makes much
more sense since it's a full superset of mirroring and it's more
universal, and not *that* more complicated to do (basically just the
HEAD stuff - and I think the race conditions around that don't matter
that much in the real life if you take some basic crude protections).
