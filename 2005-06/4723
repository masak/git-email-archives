Well, it's done, and it's now "much easier" in the sense that anything 
that doesn't have metadata changes should be picked up pretty trivially by 
the three-way merge thing.

But if you move things around, then you'd need to have a merge that is
aware of movement, ie something much more sophisticated than just 3way
merge.

With global history, you really don't end up having much choice. 

The alternative is to have per-file history, which sucks pretty bad
(you're screwed if you have a file that is touched by two things, so it
just moves the problem a bit, but more importantly you now have all the
CVS crud), or then you have to play games like arch or darcs which is all
about re-ordering patches (and then your history is totally malleable,
with all the problems that entails).

It's absolutely not horrible, but it limits how you work. _I_ think it 
limits you in good ways, but it's definitely a limitation.

My gut feel is that it should be possible to have a hybrid system that
handles both the solid "crystalline" phase (aka git) and the "gas" phase
(aka free-lowing patches) and have them integrate with each other well. 
That's kind of the way the kernel works, with people using quilt as a way 
to capture the patches in between.

My read is that this analogy arch and darcs try to avoid the really solid
crystalline phase entirely and end up being amorphous. You can probably 
have that too, but on the other hand it's fairly easy to merge between two 
"crystallized" repositories and be totally unambigious about what the 
result is, but if there's a lot of the amorpous stuff going on, it's not 
clear any more.

Hey, I obviously think you're right. Using git gives good ways of
communicating the core infrastructure between two (or more) groups, while
then internally within the group they may use loser patch-tracking systems
that don't have the same kind of convergence requirements (but which you
don't need for a "small" set of patches anyway, where "small" can
obviously be hundreds of internal patches).
