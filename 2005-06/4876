This attack scenario doesn't demonstrate the danger of hash
collisions but the danger of signing documents you do not
understand. The same technique works exactly in the same way
with postscript files which are actually identical but produce
different output under different conditions (time, fonts
installed on the printer whatever).

Never sign anything but plain text or documents which are
created in a controlled way and avoid signing documents
you did not create yourself.
