With the optparse stuff in things got a lot easier. I took the idea to
check for stole from Dan Holmsands patches to only read it when stdout
is a terminal. So the file is really only for interactive usage.

---

Introduce ~/.cgrc config file. The file is read on startup if stdout is
a terminal and may contain information about default command line
options. Each line consists of a command name and a list of options.
Lines not starting with a 'Cogito' command name are ignored.

To always have cg-log and cg-diff colorize the output put the followig
in ~/.cgrc:

	log -c
	diff -c
