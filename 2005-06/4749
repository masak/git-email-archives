  Hello,

  it turned out that Cogito was so broken w.r.t. three-way merging that
I had to really release a bugfix version. So this version contains some
cleanups of the merge script, some more portability fixes (it actually
runs on Debian old stable now!), and especially few bugfixes - cg-log
works with individual files passed to it now, and merging should
hopefully work correctly now too.

  You know what to do. :-)


Junio C Hamano:
  Add read-tree -m 3-way merge tests.

Linus Torvalds:
  One more time.. Clean up git-merge-one-file-script
  Fix up git-merge-one-file-script
  Merge my and Petr's git-merge-one-file-script modifications
  Make sure we error out if we can't remove a file on automatic merges.

Petr Baudis:
  cogito-0.11.3
  Fix cg-merge's three-way content merge
  Support for compilation w/o OpenSSL
  Portable stub for the stat call
  Fix cg-diff -p to work with no -r specified
  git-merge-one-file-script cleanups from Cogito
  Further converge git-merge-one-file-script and cg-Xmergefile
  Remove useless ret=0 in the onefile merge scripts
  Make git-merge-one-file-script and cg-Xmergefile converge even more
  Fix cg-log called on specified files
  Tidy up some rev-list-related stuff
  Fix git-merge-one-file permissions auto-merging
