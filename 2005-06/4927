I've only took a brief glance at your description and found it
quite sensible.  I did not find anything majorly wrong.

If you are talking about jit-rewind (I think the message I told
you about it was not sent to the list, so the list audience may
not know about it, by the way), there is not much to analyze.

It populates the snapshot pool with the commits in the specified
commit chain, and after that it is totally up to the user what
to do with them, hence there is no redo semantics attached to
it.  JIT way of doing things is generally more dangerous in that
it gives you so much more flexibility that it lets you freely
shoot yourself in the foot ;-).  When the core Plumbing side
stabilizes I may revisit updating JIT to make certain parts of
it not so sharp-edged, but I have been busy futzing with the
Plumbing side lately, and having found not much need to change
JIT, haven't done much about updating my own Porcelain.
