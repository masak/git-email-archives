See my (long) reply to Daniel. A StGIT patch is a collection of git
commits, mixed in time with commits for other patches. There might not
be a single author. For example, I create a patch called
'stabilisation' where I gather different git changesets from different
authors and commit them one by one.

I think what you mean is similar to the cg-mkpatch command. The 'stg
export' is totally different. While it might be possible to generate a
set of changesets for a StGIT patch, this is not intended for the near
future.
