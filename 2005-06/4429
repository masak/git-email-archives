but not if the merge does not conflict with the local changes. This is
what Bitkeeper is doing. It lets you pull new stuff as long as it does
not conflict with your local uncommitted changes. Actually I liked that
feature a lot, because I was able the follow the latest Linux mainline
tree and work on my stuff.
