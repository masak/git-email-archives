You're correct; it's actually that pull.c has never gotten extended to
look at the object you specify, determine what it is, and then behave
appropriately. Basically, it needs a "process_unknown()" which does the
appropriate thing, and pull() needs to call that instead of
process_commit(). It should also get a "process_tag()" which handles tags
(calling process_unknown() on their objects). I should be able to do it
Tuesday evening or Wednesday night, if nobody else gets it before then.
