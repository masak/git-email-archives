It shouldn't be hard to do one, except that locking with rsync is going to
be a pain. I had a patch to make it work with the rpush/rpull pair, but I
didn't get its dependancies in at the time. I can dust those patches off
again if you want that functionality included.

The patches are essentially:

 - make the transport protocol handle things other than objects
 - library procedure for locking atomic update of refs files
 - fetching refs in general
 - rpull/rpush that updates a specified ref file atomically

At least the first would be very nice to get in before 1.0, since it is an
incompatible change to the protocol.
