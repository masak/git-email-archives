Hmmm, that would create a "direct" tag, not a normal tag, which is
an object of type "tag" that contains a reference to a commit along
with some other stuff.

In general I'd like to keep gitk as purely a viewer.  Ultimately I'll
probably do a graphical tool for checking stuff in and other
operations that modify the repository as well, but I think that should
be a separate tool.

Regards,
Paul.
