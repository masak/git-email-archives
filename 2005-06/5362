If we have versions A through A+N, Mercurial will create a new revlog  
file and
store a new full version when the total size of the changes between A  
and A+N
is greater than a certain amount, effectively ensuring that  
retrieving the
latest version of a file is O(size-of-file) instead of O(size-of- 
file*revisions).
This is the same speed as RCS for the tip, and significantly faster  
than RCS
for non-tip, which is crucial for merges.
