The rpush/rpull changes were at the end of a series that you were replying
to the beginning of.

The ssh-based protocol has to change, because the current version doesn't
have any way of being extended. The first patch in the new set makes the
incompatible change without adding anything new (so as to be as
uncontroversial as possible), and now also adds a version number so that
future additions should be less of a big deal. The rest of the series will
add the transfer of refs to the transfer mechanism and the protocol.
