Hi,

        after reading it I think I have to explain it better.

        And first I have to say that this patch depends on my patches
        in the thread "[COGITO PATCH] Heads and tags in subdirectories".
        But the logic does not depend on it, I think :)

Suppose I want to make some modifications to the cogito. So I do:

cg-clone cogito rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/cogito.git

the first argument been the name I've gave to this repositori. Now I can
do the changes/commits in the usual way. But I want to work in two
differents patches, named dirs and switch, so I do:

cg-branch-add dirs cogito
cg-branch-add switch cogito

Now I have to local branches with their respective names, and the origin
been the cogito branch for both (but it can be different).

If I want to work on the dirs branch I do:

cg-branch-switch dirs

an the same for switch. In each case I can do a:

cg-merge origin

and merge their respective origin (in this case is the same).

If I want to work directly in cogito, I can do:

cg-branch-switch cogito

and work in the usual way. If the cogito repository have a branche
called cogito2 I could do:

cg-branch-switch cogito#cogito2

in the case I've already pulled this branch.

Internally it is:

Local branches
--------------

The master file is always a link:

master -> ${localbranch}

The content of $_git/branches/${localbranch} is the original branch of
local branch. The cases and the corresponding origin links are:

1a.- name         : a name of an external repository
                    $branch corresponding to the definition
                    origin -> $name/$branch
1b.- name#branch : optionally with a branch
                    origin -> $name/$branch
2 .- name         : a name of another local branch
                    $branch corresponding to the definition
                    origin -> $name/$branch

Local unnamed branches
----------------------

The master file is a regular file and the origin link only has the cases
1a and 1b where the $name is name of the local branch.
