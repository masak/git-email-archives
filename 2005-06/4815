Dear diary, on Thu, Jun 09, 2005 at 01:19:30PM CEST, I got a letter
where Dan Holmsand <holmsand@gmail.com> told me that...

I dropped the format change bit, because I really think the Linus' date
format is bad. The current standardized, international and most widely
used (even your mailer agent used it in your Date: header) date format
is RFC 822, so please let's stick with it. It's perfect for our use, and
better human-readable too. The date part isn't split all around but
concentrated in the first half while the second half is dedicated to
time.

You forgot to modify cg-log accordingly. (I fixed that.)
