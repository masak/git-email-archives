Already have this, for the non-pack case.

Right.

Or wherever it's been told to, yes.

My expectation is that the puller will have a ref "remote-branch", and
will therefore: (1) want to update it, and (2) know the last commit pulled
from it. In this situation, we can skip figuring out the start (the two
points I didn't quote), because we saved it from before.

At least, this is how I've always done it; I've got a "linus" branch that
follows the public repo, and I commit changes to a different branch. I
suppose one could skip hanging onto this info, but it seems like an
obviously useful thing to keep, if for no other reason than that I want to
diff against it. This is essentially promoting FETCH_HEAD to a refs/heads/
thing, and having separate ones when you pull from separate sources.

I suppose things are different if you do a lot of one-shot pulls, rather
than tracking branches that you pull from; I'll need to think about this
case (assuming that's actually what you do).
