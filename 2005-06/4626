May have their parents in the database; we want to be able to drop ancient
history from non-archival sites at some point, if nothing else.

It's probably true that there's no point to having a tree available if you
don't have its contents, although that's a convenient intermediate stage,
so that you can look up the contents of the tree with the ordinary parsing
code. On the other hand, I could imagine an ARM developer completely
ignoring arch/i386 (and just having write-tree use the parent tree's value
for it).

Yes. Can't unpack without them.

Right.

Also, tags reference objects of unknown type; it's probably not vital to
have the object.

My bias is to call a database consistent with only deltas having the
referents; the rest goes towards completeness, since you have and can read
everything that you have anything for (but may not be able to do some
particular operation).
