Unfortunately you cannot fix this by changing your actions.  This is the 
cumulative effect of all the git kernel trees on kernel.org.  It now 
takes over an hour for my non-git changes to propagate from master to 
the mirrors, as well.

This is all due to the rsync sweeps, which have to scan metric tons of 
inodes and dentries.  Orders of magnitude over the pre-git days.

ftpadmin@kernel.org folks are supposedly working on an inotify-based 
system, and an improved rsync application.  No ETA or details.

As an aside, cold-cache, git really punishes my disks.  Ted T'so noted 
that it really drains laptop batteries, too.

On both kernel.org and locally, I use 'cp -al' to duplicate the initial 
.git/objects directory, and then rsync (->kernel.org) or git-pull-script 
(<-kernel.org) to update it after that.

That definitely helps.

Maybe somebody needs to script a relink cron job for kernel.org?
