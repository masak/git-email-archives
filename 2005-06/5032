Dear diary, on Sun, Jun 19, 2005 at 05:42:50PM CEST, I got a letter
where Sven Verdoolaege <skimo@kotnet.org> told me that...

Well, pulling a specific branch can be done by appending #branchname to
the URL. If you use rsync:// URL, it will pull everything, too. Pulling
everything referenced by refs/ might be a nice thing, yes. ;-)
