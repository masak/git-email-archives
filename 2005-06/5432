This is the original version:
sh-3.00$ git-cat-file commit f6a92a7a774473bce12415200bab2788ea3b18f0

This is your version:
sh-3.00$ git-cat-file commit db3540e3f670d4af4acefc723bab41a077c9300e
tree a0ec41a61461476c72c3967576225bd4772b6c8f
author risset <risset> 995295631 +0000
committer risset <risset> 995295631 +0000

Initial revision

sh-3.00$ 

Note the extra empty line.
