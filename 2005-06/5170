("We" in this case being the developer checking whether the patch went in,
not the maintainer)

We'll need to see if the performance is okay this way, both in terms of
time spent searching for the patch you're checking on and in terms of
recognizing the patch as being the same. No point in designing anything
more complex until we determine if we can't just recognize it already.

Oh, I think they'd want to do that. I just don't think they'd want to do
it as often as they want to update their tree for changes in mainline,
just because no one developer will do more work than the rest of the
developers combined. And it's worthwhile, because you need to use
diff/patch for the complex cases, and can use diff3 for the simple case,
and you need diff3 if you want the system to treat "everything in patch 5
is already in the new base" as success rather than conflict.

(This is, incidentally, the case that drives me crazy about arch: if I
make a change in one working directory, copy that change into another
working directory, commit it from one of those directories, and update in
the other, I get a reject, and I then have to figure out if the changes 
were actually the same or if one of them has further modifications.)
