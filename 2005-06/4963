This patch contains a header file that illustrates a proposed
repository event logging module.

The motivations for introducing such a module are documented
in the proposed header. There are probably good reasons for
taking a similar approach to logging cache events, since
to do so would provide a robust undo/redo facility that
is guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the workspace to any
previous state.

This patch is posted to the list to solicit feedback that
I'll try to incorporate as I proceed with the implementation.

+/*
+ * Copyright (c) 2005, Jon Seymour
+ * 
+ * This module provides an API for logging significant 
+ * repository events via a logging API.
+ * 
+ * There are several uses for this feature:
+ * 	* identifying new objects to be pushed "somewhere else". Somewhere else
+ *        could be:
+ *             * another repository (via rsync)
+ * 	       * another kind of representation (e.g. an XML extract, 
+ * 		 a patch extract)
+ * 	       * another view (e.g. a GITK instance)
+ *             * another kind of repository database (e.g. MySQL)
+ *             * another kind of SCM (e.g. CVS)
+ *             * another more compact representation (e.g. an deltification 
+ * 		 process)
+ * 	* helping to locate versions of stuff when the workspace
+ *        (user) gets confused.
+ * 
+ * NOTE: this would probably be even more useful for the index 
+ * allowing a provably correct workspace undo/redo implementation, 
+ * however, let's bite-off one piece at a time.
