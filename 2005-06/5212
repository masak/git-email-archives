Linus could do:

 git-read-tree gitk-head
 git-update-cache gitk
 git-commit-tree `write-tree` -p gitk-head > gitk-patched-head
 git-read-tree HEAD
 git merge gitk-patched-head

(or, better, use a separate index file for the gitk index)

(to commit changes to the gitk script made in a git working directory)

The change I proposed earlier would be so that the system would know what
was going on and users wouldn't have to. Then someone who didn't know that
gitk was (also) a separate project and just committed changes to it would
still generate gitk commits when appropriate.
