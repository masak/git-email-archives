Yeah. I don't think it matters much, though, since the "more testsystems"  
thing will only really end up helping by a fairly small amount, at the
cost of much more complexity. The difference between "log2(N)" and
"log5(N)" isn't _that_ big, and it's even smaller when you just do the
power-of-two thing and use 4 systems instead of 5 (ie now it's "log4(N)"  
vs "log5(N)").

Also, to use multiple test-systems efficiently, they all end up having to
be synchronized (ie the next iteration needs to get the result from all
the test-systems from the previous one), so it's quite a lot of bother for
not a lot of improvement. It also assumes you can partition the problem
space well into <n> roughly equal pieces - which may or may not be true.

More importantly, quite often the nasty problems are the ones that only 
happen for one machine. Trying to make it easy for non-developers to test 
different kernels is what this is about: I started thinking about this 
when we had the "x86-64 SIGSEGV's for me" issue, where bisection was 
fairly easy in the -mm series due to a nice linear series, but even then 
you had to have tools to apply/unapply different patches etc.
