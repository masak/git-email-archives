The easiest thing might be to have a centrally-installed wrapper script
that could run programs installed in your home directory. E.g., if
"git" had a "source ~/.git-env" at the beginning, and your ~/.git-env
fixed your PATH, then "git receive-pack ARGS" should work, for a generic
centrally installed git and special stuff in your home directory.

I thought only "resolve" (as part of "fetch") updated your working
directory, so this is completely consistant.

The right solution probably involves getting each pack file you push to
the mirrors as well as to the master. They'll probably update no less
frequently than you push, and they should go through a series of states
which matches the master, so it's not necessary to have anything smart on
master sending them, and they only have to unpack the files they get (and
update the refs afterward). That should make the cross-system trust
requirements relatively minimal; the mirror can fetch things from master,
and neither side has to allow the other to specify a command line.
