I assume you mean git-rev-list D ^A

I think you misunderstood the intent of my original question which was
implicitly referring to the implementation of the bisection algorithm,
not to the bug blatt algorithm that makes use of the bisection
algorithm.

My actual question was: "Why is the bisection algorithm itself the way it is? "

A simple bisection algorithm which simply chooses the middle of the
git-rev-list output chooses a point which one could in principle argue
is as good as the one chosen by the current bisection algorithm.
However, I must admit that I don't quite understand the subtleties of
Linus' bisection algorithm, hence the question - why is his bisection
algorithm better than simply choosing the literal middle?

I'll post a patch that I have already sent to Linus which demonstrates
an implementation of --bisect that chooses the literal middle. This
patch also includes a demonstration of Linus' binary bug blatting
technique (see t/t6001-rev-list-merge-order.sh)
