Yeah, yeah. You avoided a few laws of phsyics of your own.

For example, when you say

  "(With an n-bit hash and an automated way to make harmless changes
   to source files, I can generate 2^(n/2) variants of each and expect to
   get a match, even in the absence of a better attack.)"

you kind of ignore the fact that "n" here is 160, and so you're going to 
be searching for quite a few versions of each. Also, you have to compare 
the sha's of all of those 2**80 versions against each other which is a lot 
of work in itself.

Finally, you have to make sure that al the versions make sense, and that 
people will take them 100% unmodified. 

My plan was more interesting, I feel.
