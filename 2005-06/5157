Re-base and replay local history is an approach I've been using
successfully with Arch (though it takes literally ages). Ideally, the
process should be able to be restarted after one call to
git-cherry-pick fails. It is usually a handful of patches in a series
of a few hundred that will break, usually because it's been fed
upstream. You want to resolve the conflict and resume somehow.

Sounds great. 

It might be useful to provide it a "skip" list, so that it skips
applying selected patches (that have presumably made it upstream).

And perhaps --stop-at <commit-sha> so that if a large replay fails or
yields a broken tree (not at the git level, but at the /does it
compile and run/ level), I can throw away the temporary repo where I'm
working and try again in shorter batches, stopping at "strategical"
points.

cheers,
