sshd is pretty odd that way; I think ~/.ssh/environment might get you your
local path. I thought it was just my sshd that was strange like that, but
it's probably common if yours does it too. I'm not sure if there's a
standard way to pick up a per-user version of the remote program. It seems
like cvs doesn't do anything clever, and sftp makes it a compile-time
option.

I think an environment variable for the directory to find
git-ssh-(other) in would be easiest to script when needed and would also
reduce the chances of specifying the wrong program on the remote side
(which would generate really confusing errors).

I was going for uniformity between git-http-pull and git-ssh-pull, and
between git-ssh-pull and git-ssh-push. But user@host:path is probably the
right thing, although Radoslaw (cc:ed) will want to propose something for
SSH on a non-standard port.

Yeah, they're usability issues, and I'm too willing to put up with my own
programs being awkward.
