Btw, Paul,
 one thing I end up missing in gitk is that looking at merges doesn't show 
any output, yet in many ways merges are actually the most interesting 
ones where you'd like to see where a file comes from..

Now, handling multi-way merges may be hard, but at least the normal 
two-way merges end up pretty straightforward, I think, and only have four 
cases for each file:
 - not touched by either side (ie it doesn't show up in either of 
   "git-diff-tree TREE PARENT1" or "git-diff-tree TREE PARENT2")
 - changed by PARENT1 only (ie it shows up in the git-diff-tree between 
   TREE and PARENT2)
 - changed by PARENT2 only
 - changed since both

and it would be cool if the "filename list" panel on the right side 
colorized the names by these things (only three cases - leave the "not 
touched" files off entirely, of course).

Also, it should actually possible to do a diff for these things with just
doing a "diff3" on the two parents and on the merge result (diff3 normally
expects the "original", but hey, the "original" might as well be the
result), and thus color a merge file by whether the lines came from one
side or the other or both (or neither, which would be a manual merge
fixup).

Maybe I'm crazy. But it _seems_ like a good idea that shouldn't be 
fundamentally hard.
