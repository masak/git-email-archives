I had some problems today with git+ssh protocol.
First, when using cg-clone, it couldn't execute cg-rpush, although it's
there in /usr/local.
Maybe that has something to do with that being added to the path in
/etc/profile.

Second, I don't know how to specify the port number,
the typical notation of git+ssh://xyz:port/repo didn't work.

Anybody knows what to do with these?
SSH would be very useful for me if it worked right.
