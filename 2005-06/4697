Agreed -- there's no support for cherry picking. Is there some
git-specific strategy perhaps?

For example, when using cvs, which doesn't support cherry picking
either, people running "stable" branches use a "merged" tag that they
move around to indicate how far the bugfixes on the stable branch have
been merged into head. It doesn't allow cherry picking, but it works
and it is a valuable (if hackish) practice.

Something along the lines of what I've mention above. I mean, not
literally moving a tag around, but to have some basic suport to
identify what the merge status is. As soon as we are one commit out of
sync, git stops being useful.

It doesn't need to happen inside git actually -- perhaps there is just
enough support to add an identifier in each commit msg, so we could
have ancillary scripts that perform some simple patch tracking for
simple scenarios.

When an automatic merge succeeds, does git bring in the commitmsg and
a unique identifier of the commit?

cheers,
