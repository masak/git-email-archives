New features that I have added recently to the gitk repository at

rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/gitk/gitk.git

include:

* Added a right-click context menu on the headlines displayed in the
  top-left pane with the following entries:
  - Display diff between two commits
  - Generate a patch file containing the diff between two commits
  - Create a local direct tag for a commit

* Left-click on a graph line now displays the parent and the children
  connected by that line in the bottom-left pane, with buttons
  allowing you to jump to the parent or a child.

* Pasting into the SHA1 ID field clears it first if it already
  contains a SHA1 ID.

* Checks for a .git (or $GIT_DIR) directory at startup.

I'm interested to know if people find the diff/patch generation
options useful.

Paul.
