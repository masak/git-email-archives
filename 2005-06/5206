Argh, there's a "--revs-only" thing that I was planning to use there, some 
remnant of an ealy plan (unimplemented) to use that to determine if it is 
a filename to be checked out, or a revision.

But then I never got around to do the "specify individual filenames" part 
of "git checkout".

Anyway, add the --revs-only, and the test against empty should make a bit 
more sense. In fact, it _should_ test that it's a SHA1 (and not a rev 
argument), but I couldn't come up with a good way to test that in shell.
