The latest version of gitk is at:

	http://ozlabs.org/~paulus/gitk/gitk-1.1.tar.gz

(yes, a real tarball this time, with a README even. :)

New features in this version include:

* Commits that are pointed to by a tag in .git/refs/tags are now
  marked with a little yellow "luggage label" shape attached to the
  circle representing the commit.  The tag name is written on the
  label.

* Gitk now uses git-rev-list instead of git-rev-tree.  This means it
  should be faster when looking at just a small range of commits.
  Instead of using "gitk HEAD ^ORIG_HEAD" though, you need to use
  "gitk HEAD ORIG_HEAD"; the arguments are passed to git-rev-list,
  which takes slightly different arguments from git-rev-tree.
  Unfortunately gitk still needs to see the whole git-rev-list output
  before it can start to draw the graph; I plan to address this.

* You can now type a tag name or a SHA1 id in the SHA1 field, and
  press return or the "Goto" button to jump to that commit.

Paul.
