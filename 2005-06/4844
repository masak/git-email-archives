Ok, that's fair enough. It is a sound to expose bits of plumbing to
the porcelain in a very slow and deliberate way as the porcelain is
polished, rather than automatically surfacing plumbing as it gets
created by over-enthusiastic plumbers.

My own learning experience has been exactly the other way around to
the intended use of the git script - I have been learning to use the
core git commands, writing my own wrappers where that is convenient
and adopting those of others only when I completely understand what
they are doing - I have been learning it inside out, I guess.

For example, I only recently discovered what git-commit-script does  [
and I like it - btw - nice behaviour ]!
