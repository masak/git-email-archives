That seems to work, once I figured out I had to pass in the "-o master"
option (as cvs2git didn't create an "origin" branch).

If you don't, you get a rather cryptic message:
usage: git-read-tree (<sha> | -m [-u] <sha1> [<sha2> [<sha3>]])
read-tree failed: 256

You probably want to check whether the origin branch actually
exists.

Apparently you also need to pass the '-x' option to cvsps.
Otherwise, it won't look at anything new.

It would also be nice if the user could pass extra options
to cvsps (notably '-z').
