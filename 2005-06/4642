- From the ssh(1) manpage (openssh):
Additionally, ssh reads $HOME/.ssh/environment, and adds lines of the
format "VARNAME=value" to the environment if the file exists and if
users are allowed to change their environment.  For more information,
see the PermitUserEnvironment option in sshd_config(5).

The default given in sshd_config(5) is not to allow the user-specified
environment, because "Enabling environment processing may enable users
to bypass access restrictions in some configurations using mechanisms
such as LD_PRELOAD."

It looks like something we probably can't count on for sure.
