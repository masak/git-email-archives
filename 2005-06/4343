Disregarding anything about cvs2git there is one point you may not be
thinking about but you may want to care about:  when you send something
upstream to the cvs repository and then get it back via cvs2git you will
get a completely different commit to the one your local git repository
has.  So while the file changes inside those two commits are the same
the actual commits are not and you will end up with all those commits in
duplicate because of it as well as an automatic merge commit to merge
the two commits.  If you don't want that to happen you would need to do
your local changes in throw-away git trees which you rm -rf after the
patch gets applied and you use cvs2git to get your changes.  You could
of course do your local things in git branches and then throw-away the
branch that got applied to cvs and only keep the main trunk in sync but
I personally prefer separate trees to branches.
