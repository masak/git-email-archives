  Hello,

  so I'm happy to finally announce cogito-0.11, a SCMish interface to
Linus' git storage system. (It's actually 0.11.1 because I forgot to do
some stuff before the release.) Get it at

	kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/

or just pull it if you have your Cogito tree Cogito-tracked.

  There's probably too many things which have changed since cg-0.10.
There were plenty of bugfixes, the diff format changed, the git side of
stuff made a giant leap forward, etc. It's just better. :-) (Hopefully.)

  Note that I tried to take all the seemingly-important bugfixes I've
noticed, but my feature patches queue is just huge so if your patch is
not inside (it probably isn't unless I notified you over email), don't
panic. If you think it's an important bugfix which should go in now,
please resend it. And if it's a feature patch but older than a week or
two, resend it too. I will try to process my queue as fast as I will be
able to.

  This release wasn't extensively tested and there were some last-minute
changes. So handle it with a little bit of care and expect cogito-0.11.2
possibly following soon with some more bugfixes (if there are any
problems found).

  Another thing to note if you are pulling - there are might be some
obsolete or (in case of the git-pb tree) completely nonsensical tags
in your tree, and they will slow down cg-pull/cg-update a lot now - it
will complain about them and if they don't get fetched ("different
tree" message is provided instead of "retrieved"), just rm the tags for
good.

  Have fun,
