No, it doesn't. I can see a use for multiple ^ arguments, but the use
case for multiple --stop-at-author arguments doesn't strike me as
being particularly useful. Multiple ^'s helps you prune the graph at
places you already know about --stop-at-author allows you to prune the
tree with respect to one author. It is particularly useful if you are
the author concerned because you have some recollection of being of
what you did last. I am not sure it is that useful to prune the tree
with respect to multiple authors - the results would be somewhat
unpredictable, I would think.

Ok, unless I Linus or the list disagree I will modify my patch to be
--stop-at-author.

No, that's not the intent of --wrt-author when specified without
--stop-at-author.

--wrt-author doesn't cause any commits to be ignored ... it simply
changes the order
in which they are displayed by altering the order in which parents are visited.

I'll get it wrong if I do it by hand so I'll create a test case and
show you what the default merge order would be, the --wrt-author
--author=a and the --wrt-author --author=b cases.

Stay tuned...
