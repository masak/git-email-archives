My impression is that tags are local to a given repo, i.e. they are not included
by default in the publically accessible data. The repo owner has to somehow
'tell' people about the tags, in order for them to be able to get them.

Apparently this is useful because it allows smaller groups to work together with
their own 'local' tags, without polluting the main tree.

Be well,
Zack
