Btw, as shown by this patch, the lazy git-rev-list algorithm is actually
_supposed_ to be able to handle a lot more complicated cases than what the 
command line interface allows.

In other words, maybe I should have used the same syntax as for 
git-rev-tree, because it _can_ handle things like "show me all revisions 
that are reachable from a or b, but are _not_ reachable from c or d or e.

Is that useful? I dunno. It might be useful for somebody like Jeff, who
has lots of different heads, and he could say "ok, show me what is in all
my network driver heads, but isn't in linus' tree".

Would people prefer to have "git-rev-list" take arguments like

	git-rev-list a b ^c ^d

the way git-rev-tree does?
