In the "minimum traffic", the thing to look at is number of packets, and 
penalize further for anything that requires a synchronous reply.

That's why I'd suggest just letting the client stream out the list of
objects it has - it may appear wasteful to stream out even a thousand
SHA1's, but hey, that's just 20kB worth of data, and especially if there
is no synchronous stuff, that's just 15 ethernet packets.

For the server side, looking up a thousand SHA's is pretty easy (it's
_really_ cheap if the server ends up using a few big packed objects: you
don't even have to look at the pack data itself, it can look at just the
index and say "yup, I've got it")

So I'd go for simple brute force over anything that needs to discuss
things and have a back-and-forth between server/client. And making the
client do the heavy lifting is the right thing to do (the server will have
to create the pack, which can be expensive, but you can tune the delta 
window for how much CPU the server has)
