I'll probably get to this over the weekend.

It should transfer each only once if you recalculate "refs_in_b" after
each push, right? Or is the marking for "--objects ^commit" still not
tight wrt object and tree files? I think branch-at-a-time is preferable
for the case where the source doesn't want to send quite everything, and
the target doesn't necessarily want everything named the same.

The one thing I can think of is whether things will blow up if the target
repository has heads that aren't in the source, at which point the source
has no clue what to exclude. I.e.:

parent -- new-b
  \
   new-a

If I've moved the head on b forward to new-b, and a wants to push new-a
(as a new branch, perhaps), refs_in_b has only new-b, refs_in_a has parent
and new-a, and git-rev-list in a can't see that b has parent (and
everything upwards of that). You probably just don't want to do this, but
I bet that some people will (e.g. projects that synchronize through a
shared-owner repository).
