A new StGIT release is available from http://procode.org/stgit/

What's new in version 0.3:
      * closer to the Quilt functionality
      * there is only one commit object per patch which can be
        indefinitely modified using the 'refresh' command. The commit
        objects are stacked on top of the base and can also be accessed
        via standard GIT commands
      * no 'commit' command. Use 'refresh' instead

StGIT is a Python application providing similar functionality to Quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of GIT. These
operations are performed using GIT commands and the patches are stored
as GIT commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT patches into
other repositories using standard GIT functionality.

Note that StGIT is not an SCM interface on top of GIT and it expects a
previously initialised GIT repository. For standard SCM operations,
either use plain GIT commands or the Cogito tool.

For more information, see the README file in the archive.
