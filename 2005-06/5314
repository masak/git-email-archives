No offense my friend, this has been done. It's name is mercurial.

It still have other open issue. Now it would be harder to not sync
all the heads. If I just want the clean Linus-2.6 tree, I have to
dig it out from the pack file which mixing with other heads. 

You could host different projects with it's own pack file. That
will lost the space saving on co-hosting projects.

So I am not convince rsync is the way to go in long run. You need
to have your own network syncing method.

It sounds like you are suggesting backward delta. Keeping the
latest node in full and using delta to access the old one. It should
work but it will lose the append only property.
