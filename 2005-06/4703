Nah... Seriously, that's a wise decision. I just saw that you we're 
working on cg-log, and wanted to save you some potential doublework by 
sending what I've got in a hurry.

I have, however, been using this myself for quite some time, so it's 
reasonably well tested.

Sure. I'll try to split it up, somewhat (but the changes *are* pretty 
inter-related...).

The new date thing doesn't work very well for cg-log: it's hardcoded to 
HEAD. That means that attempts to do, say, "cg-log -rorigin:-1day" will 
not at all do what you want. Not to mention "cg-log -m -r-1day". And I 
think it's a little clearer to separate the two: "cg-log -rorigin 
--max-age=-1day" (there's a short option too).

Max number of commits is perhaps not all that useful, unless you want to 
save cg-log output to file, for example. But it's easy to do :-)

Oh, and I forgot to mention the "pickaxe" support. "cg-log -S foobar" 
uses git-diff-tree -S to "search in diffs". Really very, very useful.
