I'm thinking about it. You can't actually do send-pack from the other end,
since send-pack needs to know what the base is, and the base you have may
not even exist in the remote.

So a "git-pull-pack" will follow the objects on the other side until it 
hits one we have, and _then_ it can send a nice pack. It's not hard per 
se, and some of the problems are actually simpler than git-send-pack, but 
it needs more communication (and in order to be efficient you want to not 
ping-pong a "do-you-have-it" query every time around).

I also want to make sure that the biggest burden is on the pull side, not 
the push side. I have a plan, though.
