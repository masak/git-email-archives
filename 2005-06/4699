Dear diary, on Wed, Jun 08, 2005 at 10:28:05PM CEST, I got a letter

Well, it can always go to 0.11.3 or something.  I probably wouldn't take
it to the tree just before release anyway even if you sent it split up,
since due to the size of the changes, it's bound to have some hidden
bugs. ;-)

> [PATCH] Many new features for cg-diff and cg-log

Ok, this is really too big. Could you please split it up some? Also,
I've been hacking on cg-log too (and will make it use git-diff-tree -v
yet this evening), so you'll need to update it to apply to the latest
version.

I like what's inside (at least from the description), though! (Well,
mostly. But I'll comment on specific patches. No major objections.)

Ad date, isn't that already supported now? The -r arguments can be a
date. Ad maximum number of commits, what'd be its use?
