I also think it would be good if patches extracted from git
repositories included some information about exactly where the patch
was extracted from...something like...



signed-off-by: Name <user@host.domain>
---
commit: sha1 -> sha1
tree: sha1 -> sha1

The reason for including the commits is to allow the maintainer to
track exactly where the a given rev of a patch was from. The reason
for including the treeids is to allow appliers to verify that the
patch has produced the same result as the patch submitter.
