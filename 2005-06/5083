The reason is actually that he has to end up with a different history,
which is the history of the project mainline, rather than the history of
his tree. He could, of course, follow his own history, but then
communication with people who use a different history becomes difficult.

Commits are fundamentally resistant to cherrypicking, because they give
the state of the tree rather than expressing changes in that
state. Long-term, I think that something like StGIT should be integrated
into the system and deal with generating the HEAD you get after getting
patches in.
