Shouldn't feeding "git-rev-list --object" output plus
handcrafted list of objects in 2.6.11 tree object to
git-pack-objects just work???

No.  The pull protocol Dan did expects to throw compressed
representation around on the wire (which is valid if you assume
uncompressed transfer) and does not use read-sha1-file --
write-sha1-file pair, so all three do not work.
