And even as one big file, it will _still_ be layed out on disk in
pessimal order.

Again, have fun with that. Mercurial already went down this path a
month ago, discovered it couldn't reasonably be fixed without
abandoning the hashes as file name scheme, and changed repo layout.

Git's going to have a much harder time as it's pretty solidly tied to
lookup by contents hash. If you throw that out, you might as well use
Mercurial.
