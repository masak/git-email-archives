That's a question better asked Linus, not me.  My preference
would be (1) to ask the user if he wants us to automatically run
git-update-cache to all of those files, giving him an option to
decline and sort things out himself; or (2) leave things as they
are.

The core GIT treats the index file and the working directory
contents two logically separate entities, and we always require
the user to consciously tell us what to put in and remove from
the index file.  The core GIT is all about committed tree
objects and the index file, and the working directory is merely
a temporary area the user can use to build the state the user
wishes to have in the index file.  From this point of view,
running git-update-cache ourselves without asking the user is a
definite no-no.
