Done.

I'm still thinking about this one. I think I'll just do it.

One problem here is that since we don't know how big the incoming
pack-file will be, in a streaming input environment the receiver needs to
either make the pack-file reception be the last thing it sees, or it will
have to live with the fact that "git-unpack-objects" will read some more
than it needs before it notices that it got it all...

We can handle the latter either by padding (make the rule be that
git-unpack-file will always read in chunks of 4kB max, and pad the output
with 4kB of zero bytes or something, and then you can execute
git-unpack-objects and continue reading stdin afterwards, removing any
zeroes that git-unpack-file didn't eat), or by having git-unpack-objects 
flush anything after the final SHA1 to _its_ stdout, so that you can get 
the following data/commands in the stream from the unpack-file thing. 
Ugly, in any case.
