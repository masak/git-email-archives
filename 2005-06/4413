It might be okay to have a single tree to which is applied patches from
emails sent by non-maintainers, pulls from non-maintainers with accessible
repositories, and pushes from home repositories of maintainers. It makes
sense to deal well with different ways to get refined commits into the
public repository. Of course, you probably don't want to carry out merges
there, so the cases where pull or commit loses the race are quite
different; you want to throw it back to the author for rebasing.
