Yes, you can do it that way too. It will possibly not pack as well due to
giving you fewer opportunities for deltas, but that's likely not a huge 
issue.

Right. I think that's a "feature" of pushing: you cannot push to an 
archive that has state that you don't know about. Ie you can only push to 
something that is a proper subset of what you are (on a per-branch basis, 
of course - not necessarily on a "global" stage - so you could push just 
_one_ branch, even if another branch was ahead of where you are).
