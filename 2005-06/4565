Dear diary, on Sat, Jun 04, 2005 at 03:05:26PM CEST, I got a letter
where Radoslaw Szkodzinski <astralstorm@gorzow.mm.pl> told me that...
> I had some problems today with git+ssh protocol.
> First, when using cg-clone, it couldn't execute cg-rpush, although it's

> Maybe that has something to do with that being added to the path in

> Second, I don't know how to specify the port number,

> SSH would be very useful for me if it worked right.

If you are staying at the Cogito's tip, there was an incompatible
protocol change introduced recently, so make sure you have the same
Cogito version on both sides.
