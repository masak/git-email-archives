If this is an exception, and I it is, peraphs can be treated in a special way.

As example, when adding a new parent to the pending list of parents to be processed in time-based
ordering, should be easy to inc a counter if  the last one is always the same, e.g. there is the
same very old node around, and check closer to it if the counter reach some allowed maximum.

I know it's a hack, and is not a solution in the general case, but also the last century developer
clock is very rare, more, it is a warning for a bad commit. 

Do not wait for the end of the toposort its a very big advantage for, e.g. GUI git viewers
launched on big trees with long histories.
