Well, they'd be bad in a three-way merge.

The reason they aren't bad in a two-way merge is that you don't commit the 
result - the commits have been done already. 

That's really the big conceptual difference between two-way and three-way:  
never mind the merge algorithm itself.

(In fact, in many ways, two-way merges are really just the same as a 
one-way merge, except it now knows where it came from, so it can do sanity 
checking).

As to working tree changes:

Yes.

In fact, there's a fairly simple solution, which is to remove the current 
check for "verify_uptodate()" and instead replace it with the "update" 
phase not just writing the file, but actually doing a three-way merge on 
it.

NOTE! This would not affect the resulting _tree_ in any way at all. It 
would literally only affect how we write out the working directory. Right 
now we just fail when the working file isn't up-to-date, and that could be 
replaced with instead doing a

	merge W I M

where "W" is the working file, "I" is the index file, and "M" is the merge 
result that we currently just write out directly.

In the special case of I == M, we already do _exactly_ this: we know that
since I=M, the merge will be W, so we don't do the update at all.

So in fact, doing a 3-way merge is really a generalization of what we
already do, and removes a failure case.

NOTE! This 3way merge is fundamentally _different_ from the 3-way merge
that is done by "git-merge-one-file-script" that we already do. _That_
3-way merge is done not on the working files, but on the results in the
trees, while this new 3way merge would be done purely in the working
directory (ie it wouldn't make sense without the "-u" flag).

If we do this, I'd personally suggest it be another flag, possibly "-u3" 
instead of just plain "-u".
