Hi,

I discovered why yesterday --- it's this patch:

commit deb153a75ae1f5eca628a38b911474a69edd242d
...
    [PATCH] cvs2git and file permissions
    git-cvs2git: propagate mode information
     
    Let cvs checkout in a temporary directory rather than
    using the pipe option to avoid loss of mode information.

This has a very unfortunate side effect --- when CVS checks out into a
new directory, it then waits for the time to advance to the next second
so that it can guarantee that future writes to the checked-out file
always change the timestamp from what it stores in CVS/Entries.

And when you're doing repeated checkouts, that means you get one per
second, max.  And so the git cvs import was taking one ... second ...
per ... revision ... per ... file, instead of the 8 complete changesets
or better I was getting before the above change.

Reverting the change back to checkout-via-pipe fixed the performance
problem for me, but obviously we're back to losing the mode information.
