Can you do the same for things in .git/refs/heads? Possibly using another 
color?

I realize that that may sound silly, but a tree that has many branches can 
validly be used with gitk with something like this:

	gitk $(ls .git/refs/heads)

and it results in gitk correctly showing all the different heads, but 
because they aren't marked in the output, it's almost impossible to 
understand what's up.

You can try it out with something like Jeff's tree at 

	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git/

if you want to, but the reason I noticed was that I was trying it out with
the result of "git cvsimport" in a tree that had branches. If it had had
flags for the branches, it would have been an _extremely_ nice
visualization tool, as it was it was just "cool, but I can't tell what
those different tips are" ;)
