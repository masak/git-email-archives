A was known good, parallel development for commits B and C, finally
merged into D. A bug got introduced in B, which we discover by the time
we have a checked out copy of D.

     .--- B ---.
    /           \
   A             D
    \           /
     `--- C ---'

git-rev-list E ^A shows this as BCD. Pick the halfway point C, and this
one checks out ok. So at this point we would decide that the bug got
introduced by the C->D change.

My guess is that Linus's bisect algorithm considers the branches, so
once C is cleared as good, we get a rev-list that looks like BD, and as
such can still find the exact bad commit B.
