Sounds sensible, and yes please I prefer to have it in
testlib.sh, and you would get bonus points if you converted some
(I do not demand you do all of them ;-)) existing cat/echo users
while you are at it.

Except for some minor points.

I do not think use of "local" to help readability is absolutely
necessary in this small function, and if it is a bashism, I
prefer to see it written in a more portable form.  I was
thinking about removing bashism from the test scripts, although
I have not gotten around to actually doing it [*1*, *2*].

[Footnotes]

*1* Auditing all the shell scripts to look for quoting bugs
while eradicating bashism would be another good "Janitor"
sub-project if somebody is interested on the list.

I do not know what happend to other items on the Janitor project
list.  Personally I liked the one Sean did to redo the command
line parameters using argp.

*2* Not that I claim what I have already written is bash free.
I do not have a handy reference that lists which is bashism and
which is in POSIX.  To stay away from bashism, I just try not to
use certain things that I did not use when I was introduced to
shell programming.  That list includes "${parameter#word}",
"${!parameter}", "function" and "local".
