The issue is really distinguishing the "other" branches I don't care about
from the one that I do care about. With -w, I almost certainly care about
the ref I'm writing, but that doesn't help for refs that are new (new
branches or tags), for which I care about some other thing. Also, the
failure is a bit hard to detect, I think, in that I could find I do
recognize some ancient thing that's barely useful for exclusion, and miss
something that should exclude almost everything but it's been updated. In
any case, when things go wrong we simply send stuff the recipient already
has, so it's not the end of the world. (And there's probably some clever
way of dealing with it)
