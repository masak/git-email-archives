The document was cut & paste from the version of apply.c before
you found it out "the hard way", so of course its wording is
sensible ;-) Anyway, I think we settled this part.

There are still some remaining issues before 1.0.  The ones I
personally would want to see merged and/or addressed are:

 - git-ssh-push documentation updates from Dan Barkalow, which
   he mentions in *1*.  I am the primarily guilty one about
   "other people seem to have missed it".

 - "-w heads/master heads/master" extension to the pull family,
   again from Dan, mentioned in the same message.

 - "--merge-order" extension to the git-rev-list, from Jon
   Seymour, last posted as *2*.  I have not tried it on
   something big (like linux-2.6 repository) and cannot vouch
   for its correctness myself, but I find what it claims to do
   quite sensible and attractive.

 - Tutorials you have been working on.  I'd appreciate it if my
   earlier "what about cvs annotate" example *3* finds its home
   somewhere in that document ;-).

 - "What happens when a merge goes wrong" helper script Jeff
   wanted to have in *4*.

 - Documentation from Jason McMullan for more commands, reminded
   by Petr Baudis in *5*.
