To get a clean history to push to Linus, I typically blow
away my trees and make fresh ones to stick patches into
which I want to merge.

That mostly works fine here on my local systems, but I know this
brings the master.org mirroring system to it's knees.  So what is the
generally condoned way to do stuff like this in a more friendly way?

Should I:

1) Do a git pull from Linus's tree once he takes my changes, then
   ask GIT to prune the tree?  How do I do that and how does it work?

2) Should I use .git/object/ database symlinking?

   Are there any scripts out there which do this automatically?
   Something as simple to run as "git-pull-script" and it takes
   care of using links when possible on a local filesystem.

It takes sometimes an hour for my tree updates on master.kernel.org
to propagate to rsync.kernel.org so I can ask Linus to pull.
That's crazy.
