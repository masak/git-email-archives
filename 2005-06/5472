Well, realize that "incremental packs" deltify a lot worse than a "big
pack", since pack-files don't do deltas to objects outside the pack-file.

So we'd get _some_ compression, but not as much as possible. The current
kernel compresses down to a single 63 MB pack-file (that's with the 2.6.11
tree too, not just the HEAD history), but without deltas it weights in at
about 177 MB.

So a "sum of incremental packs" should be somewhere in between those two
values, even today. For a single kernel archive.

So repository sizes aren't exactly trivial. I don't know how expensive
that rsync hash thing is, but one thing you lose is the ability to
hardlink objects, so if you have a few kernel repositories at some point
it doesn't fit in the cache any more, and then the rsync will have to read
that much pack object stuff from disk in addition to doing the hash. Ugh.
