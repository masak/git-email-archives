See below. I'd foolishly explained http-pull and rpull, but neglected to
mention that rpush is actually useful in its own right. It is used in
essentially the same way, but on the other computer. (And I need to fix
the Documentation/ file, since other people seem to have missed it, too)

Mine doesn't currently. The protocol supports a low level of pipelining
(you can request all the objects you know you want, and the sending side
doesn't care that you're sending requests before the previous ones are
satisfied), but I haven't figured out (or found out from Matt, more
likely) a good way to negotiate something more clever.

With patches I have (but have to rebase and such), you could do:

git-rpush -a -w heads/master heads/master //master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git

This would only send the heads/master file and all of the object files it
references. It would be easy to write a "--old heads/linus" which would
require that the remote value was the local value of heads/linus (I.e.,
the public value of your head that you'd been working from).

> Maybe git-rpush does this already, and I just never realized.

It currently does all the objects, but doesn't write the refs file on the
remote end. That is:

  git-rpush -a heads/master //master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git

Will cause the public tree to contain all the objects reachable from the
local value of heads/master. Then you need to write the new head by hand
if you don't have the newer stuff.
