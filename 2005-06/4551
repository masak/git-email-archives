I'm actually going to do a few different "header formats", and have 
pretty_print_commit() able to switch between them. IOW, this would count 
as just one form of pretty-printing.

I want to have the "dense" format, which has only the author and the top
line(s) of the description (stop at the first empty line), and a "raw"  
format, which has all the parent information etc (ie this one).
