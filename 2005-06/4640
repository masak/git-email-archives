Two comments on git-ssh-push from a quick try-to-use-it-but-fail..

 - hardcoding the name of the command on the other side kind of sucks. 
   Especially when the user may end up having to install his own version
   under his own subdirectory. You really want to have some way of saying 
   "execute /home/user/bin/git-ssh-pull", and since it will depend on the 
   site you're pushing to, it should probably be available as a cmd line 
   option.

   I have a

	PATH=$PATH:~/bin

   in my .bashrc, but sshd at the other end doesn't end up caring..

 - the host/path parsing is pretty simplistic and just silly. Nobody I 
   know uses that ssh://host/path format, people use the shorter host:path 
   format.

Both look pretty simple to fix, but now I'm going to put the kids to bed.
