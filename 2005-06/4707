OK, I'll bite.  Other than some minor details, the work tree
seems to be updated with the result of the merge, either
successful one or failed one.

Making sure that the path does not exist in the work tree with
test -f "$4" would be more sensible, before running --remove.

Make sure "$4" is not a directory, perhaps?  At least barf if
that 'rm -f -- "$4"' fails?

Again, make sure "$4" is not a directory before redirecting into
it from merge, so that you can tell merge failures from it?
