another assumption is that the number of testsystems is a power of two 
minus 1. With 2 or more testsystems (and automated testing) you could 
dissect the search space into 3, 5 or more roughly equal pieces in the 
first step (2, 4, 8 ... sections are already supported via the bisect 
flag). To decrease the time needed to find a bug it makes sense to 
increase the number of testsystems, especially if it takes minutes to 
boot - or if it takes minutes (or hours) to reproduce a bug. If each box 
runs a separate kernel then statistically, if one of them triggers the 
bug, only half of them have to be rebooted with new kernels, the others 
would still be kept running in a "commit space of interest".

But i guess it's not a big degradation to just round the test method to 
the nearest power-of-2 bisection method.
