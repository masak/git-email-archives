Mercurial store a full text node when it detect the delta gets too long
to reach certain point. So what you describe here will not happen on
mercurial. Having it append only is a very nice feature.

You can still chop of the history before the full node, but rebuilding the
repositories. Mercurial save some much space that you would wonder why do you
what to chop the history if you can keep it.
