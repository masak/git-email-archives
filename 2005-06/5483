Well, there are objects that reference commit objects (e.g. tag 
objects), not the other way around, but your point is well taken.

Well, what I proposed was pretty much that except to have the client 
(receiver) start first.

I prefer calling it sender and receiver, because in the case of upload 
and download you have different sides being the "server".

Well, in the common case (sender has a superset of receiver), what I 
proposed would converge on the first iteration.  I'm not even convinced 
that the algorithm *ever* needs to iterate.
