I think that, if we care much about the hashes of diffs, we should hash
the diff that's being applied, not hash a regenerated diff (unless, of
course, the diff that's being applied has been modified in hash-relevant
ways, in which case it's not going to match anything anyway).

GNU diff sometimes generates patches which are really terrible to try to
read, because it finds some line of punctuation from a removed block that
matches a line in an added block and interleaves unrelated content. It
would be nice to not have to worry about confusion if there's a mismatch.

Wouldn't the only case where this would be a problem be if we had the
committer apply the patch, generate a diff, hash it, and stick the hash in
the commit? The no-cache version has the diffs for hashing done by the
same person with the same program, and the hash-the-applied-patch version
has the hashes done on the same patch.

I think that the whole-chain case is sufficiently common to make special
and extra smooth; developers will be making their history forwards every
day, and only cherry-picking on occasion.

This is also still in the developer's messy history, and I don't think
those commits are really worth much as history or organization (although
they're wonderful as checkpointing). The cherry-picking there will
generally be content-based rather than commit-based, and will mostly be
picking out hunks to form a clean patch sequence to replace the history.
