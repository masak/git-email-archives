So you're saying that aside from that one solveable issue, I could use 
low-level git tools, third-party over-git tools, and cogito, 
interchangebly on a single repo without the tools becoming confused? 
That's cool, and should be made more clear in the cogito readme. I was 
under the impression that cogito was tracking all kinds of extra meta 
magic stuff that git tools wouldn't keep updated.

If I were using cogito, I probably wouldn't want to use the low-level 
git stuff directly, but I might want to use (or maybe even write) some 
other over-git tools.

You might also consider removing the "Core GIT" section from the README, 
because I think it increases the confusion between the two.

Cheers,

Kevin
