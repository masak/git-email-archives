I doubt that this part would work in practice.

Wouldn't you have to have some "garbage" in the early part of
that driver source, probably in a C comment block or an
otherwise unused string constant, that serves no apparent
purpose, which is inserted by your "automated harmless changes"
machinery?

Wouldn't that catch people's attention and cause them to
question and reject that patch in the first place?

Wouldn't that mean you do not have control over even _one_
version, let alone _both_ versions?
