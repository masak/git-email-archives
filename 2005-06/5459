Yes it is possible (I am not attached to the name).  The
question is what to name it.

git-fsck-cache (which is not about cache, whose name somehow
implies it is trying to see consistency of the index file, but
in reality which is about the object database --- it should be
renamed to git-fsck-objects) does the same verification when the
pack is placed under objects/pack/, and the way I envision
git-verify/check/fsck-pack to be used is to run it _before_ you
place a pack in your object database; it is like running sha1sum
on a tarball before extracting it.

Also I would like to add some "info" output options to the
git-verify/check/fsck-pack program that:

 - lists all the contained SHA1 objects;
  - with their type and size;
  - with their delta depth (if deltified);
  - with the delta-data size for each delta step.

to help optimizing the git-pack-objects.

BTW, is there a filesystem that would house the source to the
core GIT that do not like names that differ only in underscore
and dash?
