I think you got it a bit wrong.

That was the initial idea. Anyway, in a future version you will have
one commit which is trackable via HEAD and which represents the whole
patch. This commit's log should always contain the patch description
so that people pulling your HEAD know what it is about.

If this is useful, a patch can have a second commit (or chain of
commits) refering to the same tree but not trackable via .git/HEAD but
which can be useful to track the individual changes of a patch. This
would be stored under .git/patches/<head>/<name>/ and not accessible
to anyone pulling the HEAD (well, rsync might bring the object but it
can be cleaned-up). This might be useful if you have a bigger patch
and want to track its changes, only internally.

Anyway, I think I won't implement this second commit handling and the
per-patch history would be trashed. Now I think I understand why you
mean by not caring about the commit message.

Almost all of this can be done with stgit. A patch in stgit is a just
a diff between 2 snapshots of the tree. The patch is indefinitely
changeable via commit. This weekend I will implement the proper commit
handling so that every new commit represents the whole patch and not
just the last modification.

You can easily reorder patches by popping all of them and pushing in a
different order. This is done via diff3 merging.

I think the confusion comes from the fact that I wanted to put both
patch composition and change management in the same tool without a
clear separation.

Again, the log history should only be internal, if useful, and not
visible to the outside world.

Thanks. At least it is good that you tried it and provided some ideas
about what's needed as a quilt replacement. I will release a 0.3
version this weekend with the above things and you can try it.
