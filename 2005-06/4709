Yeah, my (broken) thinking was that since it wasn't in both, it wasn't in 
the working directory either, but you're right, that's just crazy talk. 
There could be a stale file there.

Made it do a

	rm -f -- "$4" || exit 1

instead (and changed the other one to do the "|| exit 1" too, since you're 
also obviously right on the directory issue).

Hmm.. What's the cleanest way to check for redirection errors, but still
be able to distinguish those cleanly from "merge" itself returning an
error?
