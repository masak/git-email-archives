No, but you can trivially do so by hand afterwards.

For example, git-read-tree -u -m will complain and say "file xyz is 
dirty, cannot merge" (or something), and what you might decide to do is 
just

	git-checkout-cache -f -u xyz
	git resolve $(cat .git/HEAD) $(cat .git/MERGE_HEAD) "..."

and note how you needed to know what the merge head was in order to do 
this.

[ Side note: I should make "git-resolve-script" run "git-rev-parse" on its
  arguments, so that it would expand HEAD and MERGE_HEAD on its own. Maybe 
  somebody who is interested in this script might want to do that? Hint 
  hint. ]

Note how we could make both of us happy by saving that temporary 
MERGE_HEAD information somewhere _else_ instead. Maybe the answer is to 
only use "MERGE_HEAD" for the "merge manually" case, and use something 
else for the "this was the merge you tried to do last" case?
