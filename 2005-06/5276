Try adding "-l" to the git-local-pull command line, to make it do 
hardlinks by default (and fall back to a copy if that fails).

Nope, nothing uses that yet. 

I think the 80MB is just because it built up the object relationship for 
the whole kernel db there. I don't know what the 5 minutes of CPU are, 
though, it should just be copying stuff (and at 250MB in and 250MB out, 
that's a lot of stuff to copy, but it shouldn't be five minutes worth, 
especially if it's all cached and you see a pegged CPU).

That copy is stupid, btw. Doing a "mmap + write" is a lot slower than
doing a "while (data) { read(8kB) + write(8kB) }" loop. The read() will
generally do better read-ahead and the small read/write will be better for 
the caches. But that still doesn't explain 5 minutes worth.

Well, with "-l" that is what git-local-pull will do too. And if you want 
symlinks, use "-s". Or use both, in which case it will try a hardlink 
first, and then a symlink if it gets an EXDEV.
