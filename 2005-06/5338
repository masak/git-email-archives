Ok, this is against an older version and doesn't have that "read_sha1" 
thing, but yes, something like this would work.

I'd prefer the encoding to be a bit different, though: make the size be
encoded in seven bits per byte, with the high bit meaning "more to come". 
We can use four bits from the "type" byte for the initial value, making 
lengths 0-15 be free.

	unsigned long size;
	unsigned char c;

	c = *pack++;
	type = 
	size = c & 15;
	type = (c >> 4) & 7;
	while (c & 0x80) {
		c = *pack++;
		size = (size << 7) + (pack & 0x7f);
	}

or something. That's even denser.

However, I also end up wanting to add a "global header" to the pack-file, 
that contains at least the number of objects packed. We may not know how 
big the pack-file will be, but we'll at least know how many objects it 
has before we start writing it.
