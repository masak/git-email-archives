Heh. It's actually very easy if you don't take the "name" too seriously, 
and you just pick some random one, namely the first one that was used to 
reach the entry.

Then, you might sort the objects on a hash based on the name, and get 
tons of cheap deltas close-by.

It is _uglee_, but hey, it's a heuristic, and it happens to work pretty 
well. It brought the kernel pack down to 59M even with just a small window 
of 10.

Thanks to Davide for making me think about this hack, although he talked 
about something much more proper (and harder) than this quick and 
ugly heuristic ;)

The main change is that "git-rev-list --objects" has been changed to show
the name the object was reached through.
