Whenever it gets slow, you could replace all the old packs with a single
new pack containing all the old objects; and master could repack whenever
it has a lot of pack files. That's pretty close to O(n) in change size.

Alternatively, having a reverse-ordered list of pack files would mean that
mirrors could just go through that list until they found one they already
had, and stop there, which would really be O(n).
