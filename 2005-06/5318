Dear diary, on Fri, Jun 24, 2005 at 03:57:00PM CEST, I got a letter
where Kevin Smith <yarcs@qualitycode.com> told me that...

I'd expect everything to work fine with Cygwin (or with only minor
problems easy to fix) or just any working bash + GNU coreutils
installation. Any issue with that?

I've planned to rewrite Cogito in Perl, but it turned out the shell
scripts really are far from the PITA they appeared to be - they work
just fine and feel quite comfortable from the maintenance standpoint as
well. It surprised me too but I don't plan to rewrite Cogito in a
different language soon.

Cogito's only unusual requirement (well, expectation) is that HEAD is a
symlink to .git/refs/heads/master, and .git/refs/heads/master should
reflect your current head. I will try to ease up this restriction so
that things will mostly work even if you just have HEAD. I think that
most auxiliary commands (e.g. cg-log - you just have to love it) should
work on any sensible git tree (but I didn't test it - yet).
