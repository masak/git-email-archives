Dear diary, on Wed, Jun 08, 2005 at 11:51:17AM CEST, I got a letter

The answer for all those questions is that git has no support for
cherrypicking (that sucks, but is hard to fix right now). git does ok
as long as one branch is superset of the other, but it does not help you
otherwise.

I don't understand what do you mean. How does a long-lived branch differ
from a short-lived one and what support would you expect/like?
