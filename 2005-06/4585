Indeed.

However, I've now made "git-apply" fully functional, and as far as I can 
tell, it would happily eat this patch. However, it so happens that your 
patch conflicts with the other patches sent yesterday, so it won't.

Or maybe I screwed up. I applied your previous four patches with the new 
magic git-apply thing, and it all _seems_ to work fine, but it might make 
sense if you double-checked it, and then we'll try this again and use it 
as the test-case for the new git-apply program.

Btw, while talking about "sensible", I really think somebody should look
my "apply.c" file over. It seems simple enough, and it does seem to work,
but considering that I just totally replaced "patch" in my applicator
script with this new thing, if it gets something wrong...
