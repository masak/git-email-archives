I think that it's important to avoid having the array of "rebased the
patch" commits be reachable from the final series if that series is going
to be merged into the mainline at the end.

If you want to keep the history of a patch, you should be able to do it by
rebasing that history as well as the latest patch, so you'd get a
two-parent commit with two rebased parents when you rebased a two-parent
commit.
