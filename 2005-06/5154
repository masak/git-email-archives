Dear diary, on Thu, Jun 23, 2005 at 07:58:13AM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...
> Does it help when I scream?

Nope. I still think you are wrong. :-) (BTW, Cogito always fetches all
the tags now - but it's not that I would have a huge problem with
changing that to some better behaviour.)

I think there should simply be two namespaces - public tags and private
tags. Private tags for stuff like "broken", "merged", or "funnychange".
Other people don't care about those, and they certainly shouldn't get
them by default (but they should have a way to get them explicitly, if
you tell them). But then there are the official tags, like "v2.6.13" or
even "v2.6.12-ck2" - if you merge with those branches, you should always
get those precisely for what Jeff says - they are big syncing points for
a lot of people and you should be always able to refer to v2.6.13 if you
have the commit in your tree.

Since there should be _few_ of those tags, you might even want to get
tags only from branches marked "tagtrusted" (Cogito's origin branch
would be by default), or want to interactively confirm new tag additions
during a pull. Also, ideally there would be no or only extremely rare
tag conflicts.

I think it would be simplest to use a special prefix for the private
tags. ~ and ! might get touched by shell, so what about %?
