Well, it's going to be slow. Of course, it's not as slow as pulling the 
stuff over a DSL line or whatever, but still..

I think I need to make something that just verifies the top <n> commits or
whatever - I need that for "pull" anyway, so that you can do a 

	git fsck ORIG_HEAD..

and it will fsck only the new stuff that arrived as a result of the pull.

And we need to improve the git-ssh-pull/git-http-pull scripts so that they
do pipelined requests: right now it's usually a lot faster to do "rsync"  
than it is to do git-ssh-pull (unless you do a small pull), because even
though the rsync ends up needing to compare the full directory contents,
it then transfers the data much faster.
