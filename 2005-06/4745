No, this is the wrong way. The 'cg' wrapper must not really do anything
special on its own. It's not a _replacement_ for direct calling of the
cg-scripts, it's just an aid for people who don't want to get used to
it. So please do this in cg-Xlib.

Also, I'd prefer the config file to be something like ~/.cgrc. I want to
reserve the .conf file for something more sophisticated. ;-)
