I suspect not.

Beware that quilt has tended toward the philosophy of doing just
what you said, with no more, perhaps less than, the minimum critical
consistency checking.  If you tried to shoot you foot off with it,
it shot your foot off, quickly.

If I try to make a change without a meaninguful log entry, what
business of stgit is that?  And it certainly should not leave the
tree in some unspecified, inconsistent state without prior warning
on account of such.

Don't add inessential sanity checks on user input.  It won't sell
well to the "quilt replacement" market.
