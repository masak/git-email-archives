Hi,

I've been tracking Cogito. This problem occurred with Cogito version
1e2673d606dd39dc44b4eed2204ba349a448bc4d

I have a directory tree with several layers of subdirectories and about 1700
files. I tried to convert it to a git repository with 'cg-init'.

The first thing I noticed was that not all the files and subdirectories had been
added. Doing a cg-status listed many files with '?' in front of them.

I tried adding these files with "cg-add */*", "cg-add */*/*" etc, followed by
"cg-commit", and this seemed at first glance to work. I was able to reduce
the number of files reported by "cg-status". But eventually "cg-add" would
say there were no files left to add, while "cg-status" would still list many
files unadded. It seemed that "cg-add" would only selectively add files.

At that point I blew away the .git directory and gave up on repo-izing that
project for now.

I can reproduce this problem easily. Please let me know if you need any more
information.

Be well,
Zack
