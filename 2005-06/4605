I think the simplest and effectivies way to handle this is the
following: Add a flag to the current merge script which indicates that
on conflicts the user will be dropped to a shell per conflict to solve:

	- Checkout filename.LOCAL, filename.REMOTE, filename.GCA (with
	  sanitychecks of course (eg not overwriting existing files)
	- Run merga -A on them and maybe wiggle and write the product in
	  filename
	- If the user resolves the conflict drop him a note to
	  'update-cache' the resolved conflict and exit the subshell.

I also have at the moment a very nice perl merge script which works with
multiple heads, duplicates and stuff. Maybe I should write this down in
bash.

The above approach worked out very good at least for me. I often had to
resolve 'simple' conflicts when pulling in upstream changes from Linus
repo.

	Thomas
