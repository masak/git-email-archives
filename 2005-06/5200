True. I will remove that. Any commit will have the new base of the
patch as a parent.

I can have two commits, one of them accessible via HEAD and the other
stored somewhere under .git/patches. The latter is just a normal
commit where the parent is the current HEAD. This will not be
generated when the patch is re-based, but only when a patch is
modified.
