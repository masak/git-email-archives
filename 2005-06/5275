I tried to start using git-clone-script to clone repositories
locally.  It crunches on the disk for a couple of seconds,
that's fine, but then I notice the disk activity stop and
git-local-pull becomes cpu bound and grows to 80MB in size
over the course of 5 minutes.

Is this a side effect of the new pack/unpack stuff?

Compared to what this thing is doing, manually symlinking
the object database, copying over the HEAD, and building
the index file is significantly faster.

Actually, git-clone-script didn't build an index file.
So the compute time definitely came from something else
entirely.
