There is nothing theoretically surprising about this, but hopefully its
concreteness and the accompanying scenario will make an impression on people
on people.  The same technique should work to generate two documents with
identical SHA1 hashes.

----- End forwarded message -----

I expected the two postscript files differing in some huge binary blob,
but it turns out the binary part is very small (about 256 bytes) and
only few (about nine) bytes are different, contrary to how people have
predicted the collisions. This is much more close to finding a collision
between similar pure C files, I think. Rather unsettling.
