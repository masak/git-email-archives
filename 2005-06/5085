No. I've cleaned it up a bit, and codified the stuff we leave around.

I also changed "git fetch" to write FETCH_HEAD instead of MERGE_HEAD, 
because that's obviously what it is (it's perfectly fine to fetch things 
for other reasons, like just checking what somebody else has, and you 
might not ever intend to merge it anyway).
