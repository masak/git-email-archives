I've been working my way thru the tutorial, trying to up my git clue 
level a bit. One part where things start to go a bit pear-shaped for me 
is in the description of git-diff-files vs. git-diff-cache. The tutorial 
takes pains to emphasize the difference between "working directory 
contents", "index file", and "committed tree", and I'm on board with 
that. What confuses me is the following:

> Unlike "git-diff-files", which showed the difference between the index

The example and the description of --cached seem to contradict the first 
sentence's description the tool's purpose in life. If it shows you 
differences between a committed tree and the index file, why is it 
looking in my working directory at all? In order to get the behavior the 
first sentence describes you actually have to use --cached.

Am I on right track?
