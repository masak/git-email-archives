Ok, I really have nothing against RFC822. But if Linus' format is bad, 
then git-rev-list --pretty should be fixed (or, rather, date.c). It 
doesn't make any sense to me to have different formats between cogito 
and core git.

And I'd really, really like to use as much of git-rev-list --pretty 
output as possible in cg-log. That makes the whole thing some orders of 
magnitude faster, and thus more usable.

Thanks. I did the "hope he takes my other patch too" thing... Sorry 
'bout that.
