Hello!

I believe the documented behavior of cg-restore is inconsistent.

"Restore given files to their original state. Without any parameters, it
recovers any files removed locally whose removal was not recorded by
`cg-rm`."

I interpret it that cg-restore without arguments restores removed files
but not modified ones.

"If passed a set of file names, it restores those files to their state
as of the last commit (including bringing files removed with cg-rm back
to life; FIXME: does not do that part yet)."

I interpret it that cg-restore with arguments restores both removed and
modified files.

Maybe we need an option whether to restore modified files?  Or maybe
they should always be restored (I think it would more consistent)?  Then
the help text should be more clear about modified files.

The actual behavior is that modified files are never restored.  We need
"-f" option for git-checkout-cache to overwrite existing files, and it's
not used whether the filenames are specified or not.  I wanted to send a
patch, but after reading help I'm not sure what exactly cg-restore is
supposed to do.
