Agree totally. And the whole pack thing is really cool. Git is sooo much
faster when running from pack-files only on my poor laptop.

Agreed again :-)

Even cooler would be pack-pulls via http. That would be a bit hard on 
the servers with the current git-pack-objects, but it ought to be 
possible to create something similar that doesn't re-delta anything, but 
instead just spits out what's in an existing pack-file, and (perhaps) 
deltifies objects from the file system.

If people then re-pack their repositories occasionally, this should be 
plenty fast, the number of files for rsync to deal with could be kept 
down, as could download times for mortal users.
