In your linux-2.6 tree, there are currently 54,204 objects, and that is 
after less than one full 2.6.x kernel release cycle.  That's a megabyte 
of SHA1s.

In /pub/scm on kernel.org, there are currently 1,815,573 objects or hard 
links to objects, which would take a 36.3 MB list to produce.

Although this is better than what rsync does, which is it encodes this 
list into ASCII with pathnames and all and it ends up being closer to 
200 MB, it isn't fundamentally different.
