I did not mention git-sync by Jason McMullan on my list of "what
I want to have in 1.0", but that was not because I object to the
idea of having a sync mechanism that knows and takes advantage
of how GIT works.  Quite the contrary.

I would like to see such a GIT specific smart sync mechanism
some day.  git-http-pull lets us use a dumb server and cannot
assume server-side smarts, git-local-pull operates in an
environment where latency does not matter, but git-ssh-pull and
git-sync are solutions for the real network environment where
latency matters, and having a smart sync mechanism is a big win.

I just do not feel, judging from its current protocol command
set, it offers enough improvements over what git-ssh-push/pull
pairs already give us; I'd be happy to be corrected, of course,
if this is a misconception.
