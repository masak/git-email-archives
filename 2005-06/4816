I'm sorry, but those two patches are still way too big and therefore
basically unreviewable. Could you please split them further to a
per-feature patches?

A good place to start would be changing the [PATCH 2/6] color refactor
to actually _replace_ the color stuff of cg-log and cg-diff with the new
common cg-Xlib code - but please don't change the default colors in that
patch yet (that is because you shouldn't assume in your earlier patches
that later patches will be applied, or applied in the form you send
them; I don't know about the less search thing yet, since I didn't test
it, since I don't have a focused patch for it).

Also, if the big changes won't make your further job significantly
easier, it's probably good idea to first do the smaller changes and then
the big ones - I'm more likely to change something, well, big, in the
big patches. ;-)

Thanks,
