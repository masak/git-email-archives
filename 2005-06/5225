I really don't want to do this. 

Can you fix the "optimized" one instead? Currently the only "optimization"  
is really to just not call it for any non-stage0 thing, the real advantage
is that the old code was totally unreadable and did everything in one big 
thing. 

I'm ok with dropping the optimization, but I don't want to lose the 
cleanup of splitting that horrible old function into two.
