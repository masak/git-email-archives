But this whole algorithm depends on comparing two git commits, so we don't
actually _have_ a diff: we must generate it ourselves from the commits we
have in the history (ie we'd compare the commit we're "moving forward"
with each commit that we're moving it forward past - in order to see
whether it's already been applied).

Now, we control both of these patch generations, so in that sense it's 
easy to just make sure we generate both diffs the same way, but I just 
wanted to point this fact out.

Right, that would mean that we don't control the hash generation at both 
points, and would make it fundamentally harder. But since the whole point 
is that we should be able to generate the ID _without_ it actually being 
stored away anywhere, this hash approach should work fine.

I'm not convinced. I think a _lot_ of people would want to do re-ordering 
of patches, combining them, and cherry-picking them if they just had a 
good way to do that.

That would then be a good way of cleaning up messy history too. Just prune 
the old tree once you've moved it forward.
