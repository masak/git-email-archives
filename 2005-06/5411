I can do it this way, if you prefer. The issue was that the expected output was:

= l2
| l1 
| l0

but became:

^ l2
| l1
| l0

The annotation changes because there is no longer a single head in the
start list. There are now multiple heads, it just happens that one of
the heads is also a prune point.

Fair enough, I'll resubmit with a less drastic change to the test case.
