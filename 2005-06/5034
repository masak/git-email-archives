Your commit is a merge. A corrupted one.

Notice: two times the same head.

You had a MERGE_HEAD in your tree, and "git commit" warned you about it in 
big bold letters and told you what to do, but you ignored it.

"git commit" said:

                echo "#"
                echo "# It looks like your may be committing a MERGE."
                echo "# If this is not correct, please remove the file"
                echo "# $GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD"
                echo "# and try again"
                echo "#"

and if you had just done as it asked you, you'd have been ok.

As to why you had a .git/MERGE_HEAD in your tree, it's probably because 
your merge scripts haven't kept up with mine.
