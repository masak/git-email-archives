Ok, done. I had to basically rewrite that unpacking logic, but the end 
result is actually slightly smaller and cleaner, and it can now unpack 
from a stream. That stream reading logic that uncompresses directly from 
the stream buffer might be considered a bit too subtle (and somebody 
should really double-check it), but hey, it works for me.

In fact, I just did this:

	#
	# Create empty git archive "~/unpack"	
	#
	mkdir ~/unpack
	cd ~/unpack
	git-init-db

	#
	# Copy the git archive there over a pipe
	#
	cd ~/git
	git-rev-list --objects HEAD | git-pack-objects --depth=50 --window=50 --stdout | (cd ~/unpack ; git-unpack-objects)

	#
	# Go to new archive, set up the head, and fsck to verify
	#
	cd ~/unpack
	cat ~/git/.git/HEAD > .git/HEAD 
	git-fsck-cache --unreachable

Now, the above is a silly example, since I _could_ just have moved the
pack file into .git/objects/pack, but that was not the point of this whole
thing. The point was to do what a "git-ssh-push" would basically boil down
to.

I'd like somebody who knows zlib intimately to take a look at how I do the 
streaming input thing (in particular, the "use(len - stream.avail_in);" 
part in the inflate loop in the "get_data()" function).
