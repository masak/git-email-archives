I considered this, but decided that MERGE_HEAD is potentially very useful
for some of the other failure exits. There's a few "exit 1"'s in there,
for example when the "git-read-tree -m"  fails because of a dirty
workspace.

Of course, you can always re-do the merge completely (and maybe that's 
what people end up doing), but at least in theory you can fix it up and 
just re-resolve. But in order to do that, you need to know what the 
MERGE_HEAD was...

So I'm not sure what the right answer is, which is why my fix was the 
minimally invasive one that only removes the heads on success..
