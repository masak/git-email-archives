My rationale was to re-use both the filtering logic currently in the
show_commit_list while loop and the display logic, since I need both
in order to maximise compatibility with the standard algorithm.

However, I understand your concerns.

My plan, therefore, is to split the filtering logic from
show_commit_list's while loop into a separate function and create a
third function which calls the filtering logic, then show_commit. I'll
pass a pointer to the third function to sort_list_in_merge_order. I
can leave the show_breaks functionality in show_commit (it is, after
all, display functionality) or I can move it into the third function.

Is that ok by you?

jon.
