works fine here and is nice and fast, but there are a few minor visual 
glitches:

- annotated file contents are not properly aligned over each other. E.g.  
  check commit 7875b50d1a9928e683299b283bfe94778b6c344e in the current 
  git repository, and select read-tree.c and view it annotated - the 
  lines start right after the author field ends, not in any aligned way.

- the tree visualization is hard to follow - gitk's output is much 
  nicer. As an example of nice rendering check out the octopus merge 
  around commit 211232bae64bcc60bbf5d1b5e5b2344c22ed767e. One glance at 
  the gitk output shows what happened - qgit's output is in essence 
  unreadable.

and a few requests for enhancements if you dont mind:

 - in annotated mode, it would be nice to select a particular line 
   and then double-click would jump to the commit that added that line.  
   This would nicely round up annotation support.

 - plaintext search capability in every window. E.g. in the annotated
   file window i often would like to search for some code, or to jump to
   a given line.
