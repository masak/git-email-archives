Actually, I don't think that "do_expand" flag should exist.

If we want to expand a packed file and really write the objects to the 
.git/objects directories, we should just not have that packed file in the 
.git/objects/pack directory.

And if we have a pack-file in .git/objects/ that already has the object, 
that may not be the _same_ pack-file that we're expanding at all, so if 
that pack file already has the object, then not writing it out is actually 
the right thing to do.

That will also simplify your patch a bit. I'll fix it up.
