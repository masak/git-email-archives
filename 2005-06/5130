Yeah. The good news is that if something bad happens, it surely lets you 
know, and it's very verbose about that.

I should probably remove the "Fragment applied at offset xx" thing, it was 
basically a debugging message to make sure that I applied patch fragments 
correctly even if the line offset given in the patch was sligthly off..

How about this patch? Then you can say

	git-apply --stat --summary --apply --index /tmp/my.patch

and it will not only apply the patch, but also give a diffstat and a
summary or renames etc..

This also removes the "Fragment.." debugging message.

Btw, "--stat" and "--summary" normally turn off the "apply" flag, so 
"--apply" has to come _after_ the stat/summary thing, fwiw:

Well, it _does_ do that. That's what the "git status" thing does, and look 
at the initial commit message comments that it prepares for you: it tells 
you which files are modified but haven't been marked for check-in etc.

But the thing is, you need to have a graphical tool for that. I don't want
to have some silly command line that asks for each modified file whether
you want to include that file in the commit or not.

So this is where "git" ends, and a nice user interface (written by 
somebody else than me) begins. Ie this is a cogito-like thing.

For (1) "bk log" is good. For (2) you'll have to use your own script, or
just have the remote tree as a branch in the same tree, in which case you
can do

	git log remotebranch..mybranch

and it will do what you expect. In fact, since "HEAD" is the default 
branch for the final one, you can do

	git log remotebranch..

and you'll get the log of everything that is in your HEAD but it _not_ in 
the "remotebranch" branch.

Btw, if you have the remote as a branch in your own tree, you can also do

	gitk remotebranch..mybranch

which is a really nice way of graphically seeing "what is in 'mybranch' 
that is not in 'remotebranch'".
