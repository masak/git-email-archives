Actually, no. I expect the old _index_ to be at least not _more_ populated 
than the trees I merge. That's not a working tree issue, that's a "we 
don't want to drop information from the index".

And yes, if you use "-u", it will populate the working tree too, but 
that's really totally unimportant from the algorithm itself.

But you can very much do everything in-index as before, if you want to. A 
pure index merge would be done usually in a new temporary index file, 
something like

  rm -f .git/tmp_index
  GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/tmp_index git-read-tree -m <base> <merge1> <merge2>

and the new changes don't change that.

HOWEVER, it's all set up to be very clever indeed. My immediate goal is to 
make the current git-resolve-script be more easily usable, and that 
implies that it has to work in the current working directory and resolve 
conflicts there. I still think that the _long-term_ plan is to make sure 
that we don't do that, and the new thing actually supports that too.

For example, notice how I lifted all the "checkout" code from the 
checkout-cache thing? Including very much the code that supports 
"--prefix"? I didn't add the command line, but imagine just adding that, 
which updates "state.base_dir", and doing

	mkdir -p MERGE_DIR/.git
	cp .git/index MERGE_DIR/.git/index
	GIT_INDEX_FILE=MERGE_DIR/.git/index git-read-tree -u --prefix=MERGE_DIR/ <base> <merge1> <merge2>

and voila, you're basically now 75% of the way to where I wanted the thing
to be in a separate directory.

So I've given up on the separate directory for 1.0 - because it's clearly 
not going to happen - but I've not given up on the basic idea.
