What I actually meant was that it would be useful for git-ssh-push to be
able to pack stuff as a function call rather than execing an external
program, because just sticking git-ssh-push at the end of a pipeline
doesn't work if you don't remember what the remote side has.

One possibility would be to put a special type tag (like '\0') before the
hash, so that the format is more deterministic.

In a completely streaming environment, yes; but the receiving side is the
one sending commands, so you don't run into the next thing unless you're
overlapping requests. Failing that, we can just keep a 4k buffer of stuff
we've already read around; we don't have to worry about reading into
something we won't want to read at all.
