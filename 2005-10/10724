Ah, yes, it does.  Thanks.

git-diff-tree -r --name-only is pretty quick and it actually does a
halfway reasonable job of representing damage-potential.

Hard to say.  Neither one is going to be perfect, so I'm ok with
settling for the cheap one if it's halfway reasonable.  I think I'll
mock up the merge indicator and see if there's any value added there.

So, what's the best way to detect merges?  Maybe see if
'git-cat-file commit $hash | grep ^parent | wc -l' is greater than 1?

Ok, but that cache would live inside GIT_DIR an be shared with gitk,
right?
