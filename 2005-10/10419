Arrrgggggggh.  The description above captures the essense of the
problem very well, but faking dates and still popping by recency
looks like a really ugly hack to me.

Wouldn't it be cleaner if you traversed commits starting from
local refs, and assign distance from the tip of the branch to
each object (use generic object->util field for it), and
maintain an object_list that is sorted by depth, similar to
commit_list sorted by commit date?  Then you can pop from the
list by depth, closer to tip first, and tell the other end that
you have branch1, branch2, branch1^, branch2^, branch1~2,
branch2~1,...  which is the order the above situation benefits
from.
