Oops, thanks for catching that - I'll fix it.

I'd thought about chaining the alternates, but wasn't sure whether it's
safe to consider all alternates in the chain equivalent.  I would want to
implement fetching the chain such that it could happen parallel to other
request and not block the pull.  I think it would also be useful to track
the network performance of each alternate and prefer faster sources as
new requests are started.
