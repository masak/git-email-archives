I think the original intent was the last modification datestamp
and the version of the documentation, but I agree it should be
removed.  I do not think they show on the HTML version, nor man
pages, although I have to admit that I haven't looked at
generated manpages for some time.

Last night I felt the same way, and an rewrite [*1*] of
applymbox I am working on uses '-i' instead.  If users do not
object, I would vote for changing applymbox to use '-i' as well.

The user community consensus does not have to be unanimous, but
anybody who has linux kernel tree on kernel.org servers has a
veto on this, I should say.  It's the tool they use every day.

Sounds sane.  What would we do if we need to start sentences with it?

Thanks for noticing.  Yes, now HTTP can handle both of the
trickier setups (packed, and alternates); credit goes to Daniel.

Agreed.

Again, thanks for taking the time to do this.

[Footnote]

*1* Why rewrite?  One reason was I was afraid to break things
for Linus ;-).  And I wanted to add a bit more interactivity and
restartability.  The ultimate goal is to make 'git-rebase' and
'git-cherry-pick' faster and easier to use.  The idea is not to
always do 3-way merge, but essentailly feed format-patch output
(now it can do --stdout) into the new applymbox, and when patch
applies cleanly things will go faster, otherwise it will fall
back to 3-way merge behaviour.
