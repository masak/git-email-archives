Seen here too.  My HEAD and HEAD^ as of yesterday's pull was:

commit ea5a65a59916503d2a14369c46b1023384d51645
Author: Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>
Date:   Tue Oct 18 18:42:19 2005 -0700

    Do not ask for objects known to be complete.

    On top of optimization by Linus not to ask refs that already match, we
    can walk our refs and not issue "want" for things that are known to be
    reachable from them.

commit f8765797a41a39f4dfc7030098c38283e6461a83
Author: Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>

    Even when overwriting tags, report if they are changed or not.

Today, looking at git-web I can see that that HEAD^ commit is still
there, but yesterday's HEAD is simply not in the commit chain any more:
there are a couple of other commits and then the "Do not ask for objects
known to be complete" commit appears with SHA
49bb805e69f97e75472e54a68e9eb24e08dee011.

Somebody broke this by rsyncing a non-superset tree to kernel.org,
maybe?

"git reset --hard HEAD^" got rid of the missing HEAD commit and allowed
me to pull from the new commit chain, but that really shouldn't be
necessary.
