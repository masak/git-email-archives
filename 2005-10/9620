Hmph.  I tend to dislike periodical posting that is more often
than once a month.

Well, the thing is, I am not good at documentation, especially
when I have other interests, and once I start writing a list of
missing or incomplete docs, my interests _will_ shift to fill in
those gaps and I will end up doing them myself, which means I
would not have a chance to place the list in the TODO file.

Given a set of objects and a set of refs (probably a handful
branch heads and point release tags), find a set of packs to
allow reasonably minimum download for all of these classes of
people: (1) somebody cloning the repository from scratch, (2)
somebody who tends to follow the master branch head reasonably
closely, (3) somebody who tends to follow only the point
releases.

The point was to make it possible to fork that part off to
somebody else; then I do not have to maintain Documentation
directory myself anymore, just like I simply slurp the latest
gitk from Paul and not worry about it ;-).
