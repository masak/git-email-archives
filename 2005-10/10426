Dear diary, on Fri, Oct 21, 2005 at 07:34:48AM CEST, I got a letter
where Martin Langhoff <martin@catalyst.net.nz> told me that...

It was missing the signoff, but I worked that around by taking your
original patch from the end of September. ;-)

Thanks. The long sequence of permissions setup inspired me to adding
cg-admin-setuprepo which automates that. I also changed the git-push
to cg-push. Please review the final result.

Thanks,
