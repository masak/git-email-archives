Oh, I did not mean that I did not *like* the implementation or
feature.  I just was unsure if that was what you and Pasky would
find useful.

I was trying to add something that would be useful in general,
but if what I did was missing the mark and wasn't something you
two found useful, there was no need to add it.

So, thanks for the feedback and background rationale.  Let's
have it in "master" then.
