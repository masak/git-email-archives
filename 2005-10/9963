Just run "git-fsck-objects" and look at any dangling commits. The commit 
and related objects are still there (unless you've run "git prune"), so 
once you find the name of it, you're all done.

First check that you  have the right one by doing

	git log <name-you-found>

and if that looks right, you can just do

	git reset --hard <name-you-found>

and you should be back in business.
