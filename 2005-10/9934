Sorry.  This is taken from the log message from the commit that
introduced the switch.

    git-branch -d <branch>: delete unused branch.
    
    The new flag '-d' lets you delete a branch.  For safety, it does not
    lets you delete the branch you are currently on, nor a branch that
    has been fully merged into your current branch.
    
    The credit for the safety check idea goes to Daniel Barkalow.

There should be a document in Documentation/howto/ to describe
how to find the commit that introduced a particular feature.
What I did to find the above is this:

   1. Look at git-branch.sh and notice that there is this line:

    echo >&2 "usage: $(basename $0)"' [-d <branch>] | [<branch> [start-point]]

   Make an educated guess that this line, especially the
   "[-d <branch>]" part, must have changed when the feature was
   added (that is, pre-modification file would not have had "[-d
   <branch>]" in it, but post-modification file would).

   2. Find such a change with pickaxe (-S):

    $ git whatchanged -S'[-d <branch>]' git-branch.sh

By mentioning this, I do not mean to say that you could have
figuired this out yourself -- the above sequence is useful for
somebody who knows the code already to do archaeology; IOW you
still need to know what to look for, so the above procedure
would not have helped at all even if you knew about pickaxe.

> Do these also flush any related object files?  Or do I need git-fsck still?

The latter.  I think there should be a general description in
the tutorial to advice the user to run git-fsck-objects every
once in a while, while mentioning that there is no need to do it
too often -- disk space is cheap and the time you spend waiting
for fsck-objects to finish tends to be more expensive.
