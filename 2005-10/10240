I took a look at webgit, and it looks like at least for the "projects" 
page, the most common operation ends up being basically

	git-rev-list --header --parents --max-count=1 HEAD

Now, the thing is, the way "git-rev-list" works, it always keeps on 
popping the parents and parsing them in order to build the list of 
parents, and it turns out that even though we just want a single commit, 
git-rev-list will invariably look up _three_ generations of commits.

It will parse:
 - the commit we want (it obviously needs this)
 - it's parent(s) as part of the "pop_most_recent_commit()" logic
 - it will then pop one of the parents before it notices that it doesn't 
   need any more
 - and as part of popping the parent, it will parse the grandparent (again 
   due to "pop_most_recent_commit()".

Now, I've strace'd it, and it really is pretty efficient on the whole, but 
if things aren't nicely cached, and with long-latency IO, doing those two 
extra objects (at a minimum - if the parent is a merge it will be more) is 
just wasted time, and potentially a lot of it.

So here's a quick special-case for the trivial case of "just one commit, 
and no date-limits or other special rules".

I've actually tried to test it (but hey, "exhaustive" is hard with all the 
different options), and I tried to be very careful to only do the 
special-case when really nothing can go wrong, and this all looks obvious.

But buyer beware.

Btw, doing an "strace" on git-rev-list shows that most of the system calls 
by far are the dynamic loader. Now, those accesses _should_ all be cached, 
so they should be fast and low-latency, but it's entirely possible that 
for a server configuration you might want to actually link things 
statically. Or not. Just a thought.
