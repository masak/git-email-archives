Yeah, the first one was intended to capture the
operations discussed the first four points of the
"The Workflow" section of the main Git doc page.

The second is "more of same", but the one picture with
every ASCII arc on it was getting confusing and crowded.

Ah!  Of course.  Thanks!

Discovering how this related was a key insight for me. :-)

Ooh.  Yes!  Good idea.

Yeah, I even meant to add that sentence before
sending the mail.

Ah!

Indeed. :-)

Would it be a useful option to git-show-branch
that would state the commit SHA1s as well?

    % git show-branch --show-revs
