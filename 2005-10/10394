Dear diary, on Thu, Oct 20, 2005 at 05:50:20PM CEST, I got a letter
where "H. Peter Anvin" <hpa@zytor.com> told me that...

Yes. I agree that while it seems quite complex compared to what we have
now, your proposal has good points. But if we are going with the
challenge-response at all and if we are going with the simple form,
I was merely trying to make sure that it is as compatible as possible.

Yes, option negotiation would solve this for us. But my scheme _is_
backwards-compatible in the way that new client taking to old server
will not be disconnected, so it's 50% better than the original proposal.

But I think that considering the long run, we should either not do this
challenge-response thing at all, and fix the problem by other (Linus')
means, or go for the "complex" scheme. I'd prefer the latter - sending
the error messages to the client alone is a huge improvement.
