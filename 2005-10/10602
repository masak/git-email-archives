I just realized that I have two refs you would rather send the
last while fetching from me most of the time: junio-gpg-pub tag
and todo head.  If you manage to get acked either by non multi
aware remote before saying "have" on anything on the main
branch, I think you would get *everything* back --- which is
quite bad.
