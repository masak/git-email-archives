Somewhat weirdly, the version of curl on my desktop doesn't actually have 
an implementation of curl_multi_info_read, although it's in the header 
file and documentation. So you'll want a version check somewhere, I think, 
which should probably just disable parallel transfers.

It should be fine to download objects and a pack that contains them at the 
same time, although there's currently a check in fetch.c which should be 
removed, so that it will call fetch() for an object if the object appears 
between the prefetch() and the fetch().

I should be able to review this over the weekend. What sort of performance 
are you getting at this point (in terms of bandwidth utilization)?
