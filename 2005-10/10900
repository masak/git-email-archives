For an example of how to make it a first-class operation, it might be
worthwhile to look at Chris Mason's "Mercurial Queues" extention to
Mercurial:

	http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MqExtension

I've used it once or twice, and hg mq is definitely very nice and
convenient, and it makes commits a first-class operation.  On the
other hand, I've found that the combination of quilt and
Mercurial/BK/git works just fine, even for my own internal development
of (for example) the e2fsprogs tree.
