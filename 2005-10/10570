Could you please also trim the mails you are replying to a bit?

Dear diary, on Tue, Oct 25, 2005 at 11:11:54AM CEST, I got a letter
where Andreas Ericsson <ae@op5.se> told me that...

Urgh. Now this is ugly. What about making it a bit more intrusive while
quite more saner?

Also, when you already solve this for non-__GLIBC__ systems, I doubt
that there is any win in keeping the __GLIBC__-specific hack, except
that most developers won't see any bugs in the generic solution since
they are using glibc.

Someone said that converting main()s to git_main()s would help the
libification effort, but I suspect that you actually want to set the
progname to whatever you call when you call its git_main().

We can make it go into the init section, but that won't be too portable
either.

So I'd say just add setup_progname("foo") at the start of your main().
