_Yes_, it wasn't ever intended to be published, and the help output doesn't 
seem, at a quick look, trivially parsable (the source is better to parse but 
I refuse that. Also, some options require still a special handling.

The best idea seems to write a Python script sourcing the Stgit source 
(stgit/main.py to get commands, and then loading each class and iterating 
over the "options" module member). I'm not fluent in Python enough currently, 
but when I'll find time I'll probably study a bit reflection and write this 
down (my Python experience amounts to some random readings on reviews and a 
couple of days with Python docs).

Btw, what do you think about speeding up completions by reimplementing things 
like "stg applied" or "stg unapplied" via cat (as noted in the comments at 
the beginning of the script)? Tab completions can easily livelock a shell on 
a busy system, so it's worthy speeding the thing up.
