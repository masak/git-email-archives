Ok, I'll look into that. Probably it'll be around "opts_push="-a --all -n 
--number...", i.e. this one works fine, through name indirection, i.e. you 
say "expand the var which name is given by this expr".

I believe it is, yes.

They _would_ behave like cat, except that Python is slow enough. Half a second 
on a (almost) idle system means seconds and seconds on a busy system, and 
it's pretty frequent that when I don't wait enough for an op. to complete I 
get a traceback from the import statements, which haven't been completed. 

And let's leave Gentoo's emerge alone - I'd say imports can take up to a 
minute.
