Which "inherent and rather nasty problems" are you referring to?

I do not know of any merge case which is either cleanly merged to the
wrong result by git-merge -s recursive, or cleanly merged when it
should be a conflict. (At least not if there aren't any directory
renames going on) If you know about such an example I would be very
interested in taking a look at it.
