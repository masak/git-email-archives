	I was being slightly facetious.  Of course everyone makes
mistakes and corrects them.  But if you _want_ the history, you have to
take it.  Otherwise, you are required to throw away the history
completely.  And that -- do you want the whole history or none of it --
is the crux of my question.

	I could care less about preserving my public image.  I'm an
idiot, I screw up all the time.  I only care that the tip of my tree is
respectable.
	I've seen arguments from folks on both sides -- the intermediate
history is important, warts and all, vs throw it all out for a clean
public history.  It seems that you fall into the second camp.
	That's fine, but can we make that work model a first-class
citizen?  Can we get a script that pulls one branch as a single,
un-historied (sic) commit into the current branch?  If this is The Way,
I should have to be mucking about with many steps of diff/patch (at
least unless my change is large enough to require split patches).
