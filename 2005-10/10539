Sure you can. 

The #undef won't necessarily _do_ anything, but it protects against 
systems where it is a #define. Then, the #define makes sure that if it's 
anything else, the #define will take precedence.

So yes, it's ugly, but it definitely is safe in practice, as long as the 
local headers are included before the system ones.

I think Junio's patch (that renames things) is possibly the "cleaner" 
alternative, but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to just 
using the standard names. No chance of somebody using the wrong version by 
mistake.
