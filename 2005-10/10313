Dear diary, on Wed, Oct 19, 2005 at 10:56:35PM CEST, I got a letter
where Martin Langhoff <martin.langhoff@gmail.com> told me that...

That must be leftover of some old fetch, before cg-fetch got fixed wrt.
this issue.

The "optimization" or something alike needs to be there at least for the
user interface, so that we can actually say what tags are we
downloading; besides, there can be a *lot* of tags. But I'm not sure how
moot will this all be after Cogito moves to the remote peeking (Real
Soon Now, promise ;-).

Eek. Did I miss something and are multiline refs meaningful now? If not,
they are pretty bad and I'd imagine other parts of Cogito would be
pretty confused about that. I'd call this a corrupted repository,
tough. Perhaps a check should be added to fsck.
