Is it the standard practice to have iconv in /usr/local on
OpenBSD, or is it just your particular setup?  If the former
that's fine, but if the latter, I am afraid that this change
does not belong to the PLATFOR_DEFINES of the Makefile.

I had to work this exact issue around on a borrowed Solaris box
today (eh, yesterday), and near the proposed update branch head
there is a commit to let you specify where to find iconv stuff
from the command line of the make (or gmake).  The box had some
home compiled stuff in unusual places, so the site specific
things are made configurable via make command line, without
hardcoding particular value in the Makefile.

In either case, thanks for the patch, and please let me know
about the /usr/local vs iconv issue.  If the answer is "yes
iconv is in /usr/local everywhere on a vanilla OpenBSD box",
then I'll queue this patch on top of my today's Solaris
portability patch.
