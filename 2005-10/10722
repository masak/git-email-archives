That only shows the top-level names, so when 100s of files changes in
a subdir it looks just like one entry.  It's ok when there's no
subdirs, but it just doesn't work when 95% of the code is under,
e.g. src/.

True.  Maybe gitk and gitweb can share a cache containing the tree
diffs.  Or maybe git-core can cache tree diffs?

It's trivial to, e.g. use a different image for merges, maybe based on
# of parents?

But, in general, is there interest in a visual indicator of commit
size and/or type in gitweb?
