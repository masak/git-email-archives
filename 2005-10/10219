Probably doesn't make a huge difference, but it might be worth trying.

There's a cheap test you can do _before_ you even start walking: check if 
you have the object that is pointed to by the remote ref at all. If you 
don't have it, then you know it can't be reachable from any of the local 
refs. And if you do have it, the likelihood that it _is_ reachable is 
likely pretty high. 

(I didn't do that for the current fetch-pack optimization, since just 
doing the read_ref() is likely faster than even bothering with the object 
lookup. But if you start traversing commit lists, it suddenly becomes 
more worthwhile).

You'd need to look up the object anyway in order to figure out that it's a 
commit (or points to a commit).

So it might be wasting a bit of time, but the good news is that it wastes 
time on the _client_ side, where we've got plenty.

I'll see if I can come up with a good patch.
