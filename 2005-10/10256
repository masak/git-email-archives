Yes, I understood and agreed to that logic on May 27th.  That's
why the message you are responding said we could add a new flag,
to give the choice to the user to accept full-tree scan.

The "diff-tree --stdin that follows rename history" example
might want to have some change in either the core side of diff,
or in the rev-list.  It may help to have both.  I still haven't
thought through the issues.

BTW, I really liked your example that piped multiple diff-trees
together.  That is a neat trick.
