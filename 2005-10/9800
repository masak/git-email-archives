Hmm; my intended convention was that fetch() would always be called if 
prefetch() was called, even if something had happened to make it appear in 
between (e.g., prefetch() causing it to be fetched or a different call to 
fetch() speculatively also getting it).

The ssh transport actually wants to not have the check (if the object 
appears out of nowhere after we request it, we still want to read it out 
of the connection). 

The local transport probably ought to have the check added on line 169 of 
local-fetch.c

In general, transports need to deal with this case themselves, because the 
core code doesn't know if they started something in prefetch() than needs 
to get finished in fetch().
