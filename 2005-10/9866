Perhaps have a bit in the index mode for the file to say that the mode in 
the filesystem is unreliable, which gets set if a stat of the 
newly-written file doesn't match the mode it was supposed to have, or if 
git chmod is used to change it; then, if the bit is set, ignore the mode 
in the filesystem and just use the mode in the index.

This should prevent modes from magically changing, even if the user 
doesn't do anything special.
