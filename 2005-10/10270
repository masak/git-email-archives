Ok -- I can now shed some light on this. This was happening on a
DebianPPC machine, but I didn't have clear evidence of that being a
factor (specially when Linus is widely known to use a PPC, and I
hadn't seen problems in other ppc boxen around). Now I do.

For all my finger-pointing, cg-fetch was trying to fetch the refernces
properly. However, git-fetch-pack is segfaulting on this Debian PPC
(etch). This is true of the current git "master" and 0.99.8.c. I
don'thave strace on the box until tomorrow, so I can't tell you more
about it.

On Debian i386 and Ubuntu i386, the exact same versions work correctly.

I'll post more info as soon as I can get my hands on strace,

cheers,



martin
