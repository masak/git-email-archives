Btw, "git-whatchanged" really _can_ hide real stuff, namely when nothing 
changed.

A commit that has no changes at all (which is quite possible) will never 
be shown by git-whatchanged. 

So in many ways, "git log" is the way to see all commits. 
"git-whatchanged" is really just a way to see the _changes_, and by 
defauly it ignores merges just because the changes are "complicated".
