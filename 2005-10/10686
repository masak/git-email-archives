Dear diary, on Wed, Oct 26, 2005 at 11:11:49AM CEST, I got a letter
where Martin Langhoff <martin.langhoff@gmail.com> told me that...

Aha, so you are not aiming for proper two-way incremental i/e, and one
will have to cherrypick to import after an export... well, I guess that
can be good enough for many cases. But to use Linus' words, the really
interesting problem is to have the proper revision tree in the CVS heads
as well, so that you could do normal merges. And it shouldn't be _that_
hard either...

I *think* someone actually really did something like that. ;-)
