Well, it is full two days since a majorly visible git protocol
enabled server has been announced, and you probably know what
kind of hits you are getting (and please let us know if you have
numbers, I am curious).  If we do a protocol change, earlier the
better.  You already said that the kernel.org git is
experimental.  Does anybody run git daemons and rely on the
current protocol?

I suspect it would not make *any* sense to have a backward
compatible server that optionally allows this cookie exchange --
attackers can just say "I am an older client".  OTOH, it
probably makes sense to have an option on the client side to
skip the cookie exchange stage.  I do not think autodetecting
new/old server on the client side in connect.c is possible.
