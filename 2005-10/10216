Hi,

I have a small suggestion to make the diff of a renamed file a bit
more meaningful.  I have a file that is renamed-edited and commited. 
git-diff-tree -M -p <commit> shows one result and git-diff-tree -M -p
<commit> <filename> shows another.  If they both show a rename
occurred then I think the single file git-diff-tree will be more
useful.

Any strange idea I have is to make git-diff-tree traverse the list of
commits (assuming the list is returned from git-rev-list) to trace
renames of the file to its origin.  Of course I don't know how useful
this is to most.

David
