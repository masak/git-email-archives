They are not *wrong* per-se.  They are tags to tree objects
without any associated commit history -- that makes them
inappropriate to be used as branch heads.

Linus or somebody authoritative could do:

    $ commit=$(echo v2.6.11 | \
      git-commit-tree c39ae07f393806ccf406ef966e9a15afc43cc36a)
    $ git-tag -s -m 'v2.6.11 canonical "fake" commit' v2.6.11fake $commit

and tell everybody interested to have:

1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 xxxxxxxxxx

(where xxxxx... is the value of $commit above) in their
info/grafts file.  Then we *could* pretend that v2.6.12-rc2's
parent is v2.6.11.  You could branch off from v2.6.11fake commit
and base your development, and later you could merge that into
later development history (say, v2.6.14-rc5) if you wanted to.

If Linus does something like the above, the graft probably be
better done between the current v2.6.12-rc2 based commit history
and the corresponding commit in the history resurrected from
BKCVS (torvalds/old-2.6-bkcvs.git).  Then you could even base
your development on top of v2.4.0 ;-).

Funnily, v2.6.12-rc2 commit in the current history and BKCVS
v2.6.12-rc2 commit in the resurrected history have different
tree IDs.

I am however not quite sure how useful the above would be,
though.  EVen between 2.6.11 and 2.6.12-rc2 much have happened,
so unless the changes you are making apply to the part that did
not change between those two, merge conflict resolution might be
quite a chore.
