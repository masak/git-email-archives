When everybody uses more recent clients, you could say
"/pub/scm/.../torvalds/linux-2.6.git/objects" in your
objects/info/alternates file and not worry about step (1).  git
native transport has known about the alternate mechanism since
the inception.  The alternate mechanism support in "git fetch"
and "git clone" for rsync and http transports is a relatively
recent addition (appeared just before 0.99.7).

So (1) is not necessary for git native transport once you have
"alternate" file, but for other transports (1) is probably still
helpful at this point.

Also, enabling hooks/post-update in your public repository would
save you from worrying about (3), provided if the only way you
update it is by pushing into it, which I think is what usually
people are doing.
