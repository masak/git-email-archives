Yes, that's what I had in mind.

Yes.  Or more generally, if it's any UTF-8 control character.

Why quote the raw bytes?  Is this for terminal escapes on older xterm
(or xterm-like) implementations that don't understand UTF-8?  If so,
I'm not sure I'd bother, as it would introduce a lot of annoying
quoting with perfectly reasonable UTF-8, and (if we assume the world
is moving to UTF-8) it addresses a problem that is going away.

Yes, that makes sense.

It's not trivially short, yes.  But it shouldn't be that hard.

Also, I guess we don't have to write it, at least not at first.  As
long as we specify something like the C quoted-string format mentioned
earlier, we can encode into that format using a naive algorithm (e.g.,
quote any non-ASCII byte or ASCII control character), and beautify the
encoding method later.

Yes, that's the idea.

Also, the interchange format is the most important thing.  We have to
decode anything that is in the format, and we must encode into the
format.  Encoding prettily is nice, but not necessary.
