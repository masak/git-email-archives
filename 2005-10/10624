I think you should be able to do something similar to what
git-show-branch --independent does, except that the current
show-branch implementation sucks.  It wastes one-bit per ref
head, which is not too bad if we deal only with branches (who
would sanely keep more than 29 branches in a repo except Jeff
;-) but is useless for a repository with any reasonable history
and a lot of tags.
