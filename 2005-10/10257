Ouch.

I suspect these would be quite different between DSL and
localnet, so I doubt if there is a reasonable default value to
quick give-up.

On the other hand, having _no_ activity for say 30 seconds would
indicate a dead link on either modem or localnet.

BTW, I've been thinking about giving defaults by shipping
templates/config (i.e. no compile-time defaults).  One trick I
found cute is to have "clone.keeppack = 1" in the templates to
be applied for any newly built repository, especially now
kernel.org has git-daemon enabled.
