I thought we'd decided on uninterpreted byte values for blobs, filenames, 
and trees (and everything in the working tree), but using UTF-8 for tag 
and commit objects.

Consider if you started a project in EUC-JP, and then decided to switch to 
UTF-8 later (when your environment handled it cleanly, perhaps). You could 
convert all the file contents and move files to re-encoded names, but 
you'd then want to commit these changes and have the log before and after 
simultaneously intelligable.

It wouldn't be hard to convert at some point between the editor and the 
commit object, and you don't re-edit the commit objects like you do 
tracked files. It probably wouldn't even be hard for commit-tree to 
convert its input based on locale. (And stuff which prints commit contents 
for user consumption probably ought to re-encode it if necessary, too)
