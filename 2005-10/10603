It drives me nuts when an error message shows only basename not
full path and I find out that I was running a wrong executable
much later after wasting a lot of time trying to debug it.  But
I think "usage: " saying the basename only is user friendly and
a good convention.

This is slightly debatable.  I'd rather see it error out for one
thing, and we might want to do a sane default given no arguments
later.

Probably.
