What is the difference for a porcelain between error out,
presumable with an error message, and printing the usage alone?

Is there any dependency of porcelains to the fact the e.g.
"git-rev-list" currently does nothing if not called with a
commit-id? Somehow I think "git-rev-list" should give an error,
as the usage string (with lots of options on a line of its own ?!)
requires a commit-id as argument.

BTW, the error message of "mv" is:
===
mv: missing file operand
Try `mv --help' for more information.
===
What about something similar to this? Mentioning the command
which triggered the error is probably a good idea.

And I would add as another convention:
* "git-cmd -h" always should give the usage, and not error out
with "fatal: Not a git repository" before.
