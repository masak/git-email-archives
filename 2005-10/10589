I've found that whenever one does a network daemon which exports paths, 
sooner or later one wants namespace management.  In Linux, of course, 
there are a lot more tricks one can play to actually create the 
namespace one wants in the filesystem (although it's complicated by 
needing to have an exec-worthy environment.)

It might be worth to consider creating a library to do this.
