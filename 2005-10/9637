Are these all before 1.0, or are some of them supposed to happen 
eventually but later?

I think this should be a post-1.0 thing; I think after 1.0, we should 
rearrange a lot of the code to make more sense from a programmer 
perspective.

I thought about this some more, and realized that the operation to get 
additions to the gitk history out of a git repository is going to be slow, 
because you don't know the correct hashes for parents until you go all the 
way back. Still worth doing, but less exciting than I'd hoped.

I've almost got a suffix-tree-based diff that works reasonably well, 
that's built as a library, and outputs unified diff. I need to merge it 
with git, hook up input from trees and blobs, and test it on a wider set 
of data.

I'd also like to add:

 * Accept patches to fetch multiple objects by HTTP in parallel.

I think this may be necessary to get good performance without rsync for 
repositories hosted without specific git support.
