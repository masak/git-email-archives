The syntax differences I'm aware of:

 - the git ".ini" parser is case-insensitive in the variable names. I 
   don't know if this is true in general. I do know a lot of people use 
   MixedCase things, but I don't know if it's because they care, or 
   because they think it's so pretty.

 - the git parser accepts either ";" or "#" as comments, and anywhere on a 
   line (not just at the beginning). Again, others may or may not do the 
   same.

 - the git parser wants a "=" for the assignment. I think the Python one 
   also accepts ":". If people care, we could make the git parser allow 
   either.

 - duplicate entries. The git parser allows them, and will just pass them 
   on multiple times. In fact, I had a patch (that I threw out) that 
   depended on this, and allowed you to rewrite hostnames for git_connect 
   with something like

	[host]
		rewrite = "host.com:" "git://git.host.com/"
		rewrite = "other.org:" "rsync://rsync.other.org/"

   and the git config file parser happily just parses this as two 
   different entries for "host.rewrite"

 - quoting. This is likely the big one. The git parser thinks only the 
   regular '"' character ("rabbit ears") is a quote, and passes single- 
   ticks through unmolested. I don't have a clue what others do, if 
   anything.

In the absense of quotes, most should be trivial to handle by just being 
careful.
