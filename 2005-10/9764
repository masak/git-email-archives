Ahh, that I can definitely agree with. In fact, it makes perfect sense.

However, it assumes that everybody is a git user, which isn't actually 
true. Also, I'm wondering whether the advantages outweigh the 
disadvantages: it would make the diff uglier. We'd have to add that SHA1 
there somewhere (either on the "diff" line itself, or as anothe rextended 
git line like the "rename from/to" lines - a "original <sha1>" line).
