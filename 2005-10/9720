Ok.  Looks pretty simple.  FWIW, I've just built git on windows and I
don't see this behavior.  For the most part, it "just works".

I do see the gitk behavior but I'm tk illiterate too, unfortunately, so
I can't help there.

Cygwin's tcl/tk is a funny beast.  It is primarily included (by me) to
allow for the operation of the insight debugger and is more windows than
POSIX.  As was noted, it doesn't interact with Cygwin/X but just draws
windows using the Windows API.

So, tcl/tk are just barely supported in Cygwin currently.  I'm actually
a little surprised that it works as well as it does with gitk.
