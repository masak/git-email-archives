History matters. History matters as much as the data does.

It _does_ have to be a fast-forward, if you expect the tree to have the 
same content as Junio's.

Even if it merges everything automatically, if the history is different, 
it could in theory at least merge _differently_ than what Junio had. Plus 
you'll have a really ugly version history for no good reason.

But yes, it will _work_. It just won't work the way people expect it to, 
so they'll make bug-reports about not being able to merge automatically, 
and others will say that they can't re-create it and blame the wrong 
person.
