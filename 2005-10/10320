This kind of password authentication has several problems that make it
fairly unpractical.  It is prone to easy dictionary attacks for one thing.
It also for a spoofed server to do replays, and the likes.  It also
requires the server to store plaintext passwords.

There are other, much better, authentication algorithms, but short of doing
signatures, none are really much more secure.  The closest you'll get to
secure remote passwords is SRP <http://srp.stanford.edu/>, which is quite
good, and doesn't even require plaintext passwords to be stored.  It might
just be easier at that point to use signatures, though.
