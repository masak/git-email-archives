Ah, that indeed is broken.

We probably should fix it at two levels.

Unless a test is trying to make sure the hook mechanism works, I
think we should not have them in the t/trash/ test repository.
The initial git-init-db done at the end of t/test-lib.sh should
be changed to run with an explicit --template= parameter to not
copy templates from random places.  If somebody is going to do
this and supply a tested patch to me, it will also be nice to
add tests to specifically check the hook mechanism while she is
at it.

I think the original idea of using executable bit to control
whether the hook is enabled or not is still sound, but it may be
safer to have hooks in templates to have a suffix such as
.sample in their names *and* be executable --- the set of hooks
copied from default templates are still disabled, but now
instead of asking users to "chmod +x foo-hook", we ask them to
"mv foo-hook.sample foo-hook" if she wants to enable it.
