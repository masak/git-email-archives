Guys, why do you want to drop it? We've always had it, and it doesn't 
really hurt.

Yes, gitk got a new empty line because I didn't realize that the output of 
"git-diff-tree $commit" is slightly different from "git-diff-tree $t2 
$t2", but hey, that was due to a gitk change, and I think it should be 
trivial for gitk to just react to it.

So if we add a new flag, please make it go the other way: one that makes 
the output really quiet, but keeps the standard output the same.
