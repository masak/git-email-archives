Yes.  "encoding convertfrom" should do the trick.  In some projects, 
there may be files written in different encodings, such as gettext *.po
files.  A patch updating several *.po files would have different parts
in different encodings.

I think gitk could have a submenu in the popup menu with the encodings
to chose from.

I agree.
