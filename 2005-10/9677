Thanks.  This is "lightbulb" moment for me.  I did not realize
branches/ files are "per head configuration" -- I just thought
they are arbitrary tokens, and by convention it can only slurp
into the branch with the same name as the file.  I even thought
about mentioning the possibility to enhance the current

    url://to/repo#rembranch

to
    url://to/repo#rembranch1:localbranch1,rembranch2:localbranch2,...

but I am glad I didn't -- localbranch cannot be anything other
than the filename because by definition the file is to describe
the local branch of the same name, and describing more than one
localbranch does not make sense.  OTOH,

    url://to/repo#rembranch1,rembranch2,...

may make sense now --- you are telling this local branch pulls
(and makes Octopus) from multiple remote branches.

Anyway, I think I understand what you meant to say now.

I think this is about branches/ file: "One head name of the
local repository is used as a shorthand to name the remote
repository described by the file, inside the local repository".
