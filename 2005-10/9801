When I re-read the code, I think that check was probably a wrong
fix to begin with.

The original problem sequence, when the http-fetch was still
synchronous, was this:

 (1) we ask for an object, fetch_object() did not find one and
     fetch_pack() got a pack that contained the object and
     installed it;  the pack is removed from the "yet to be
     downloaded from this repository" list.

 (2) we ask for another object, fetch_object() did not find one
     and fetch_pack() was asked to see if there is a pack we
     have not downloaded that contained the object -- the pack
     downloaded in step (1) did not count, and this request
     failed.  Overall fetch() said "Nope, I cannot get it", when
     it already had one.

We should remove that check as you suggested, and fix fetch()
implementation in http-fetch.c to notice the above situation,
perhaps?
