I believe that the situation is the one you describe in your previous 
message: we determine we need to fetch A and B; we ask for A; we ask for 
B; we find A isn't available alone, but is available in a pack; we get the 
pack; we find we now have B (in the pack); the request for B (which would 
probably fail) is left dangling.

The only actual problem I can see is if this happens with a whole bunch of 
objects at the beginning of a big download, and all but one of your 
connections are left in this state while you download all of the loose 
objects over the one connection that got the pack.

I don't know if this is a problem for the new http code, but it could be 
an issue in general if a transport method allocates resources in 
prefetch().
