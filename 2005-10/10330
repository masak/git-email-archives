Right, I keep forgetting about tags. And again right, like I said, it is 
suboptimal but helps the common case.

Why not split it here, and do a separate block here:

And here I am at a loss: why only continue if p is empty? I mean, remote 
could be a tag, and still be complete, no?

If the git-rev-list call goes, this probably gets prettier. I'll try to 
come up with a patch.
