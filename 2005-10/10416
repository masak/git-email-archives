I have not closely studied the user of this change, rev-list,
but I have a hunch that you might be better off, if you define a
new diff "format", DIFF_FORMAT_CALLBACK, and hook into
diff_flush(), instead of hooking into diff_addremove() and
diff_change().  Instead of calling diff_flush_raw() or
diff_flush_name(), or diff_flush_patch(), your callback function
would be called with each filepair.

Right now, you are only making the parallel tree traversing and
comparing part from diff-tree available in the library form
(which is fine), but that way leaves the door open for it to
also use the rest of the diffcore machinery.

By doing things this way, later round of rev-list that culls
uninteresting commits could be taught to also follow renames.

Am I grossly off the mark?
