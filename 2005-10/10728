Thank you for reply!  git-patch-id is badly documented, and its output
is not documented at all.  It outputs two SHA1 hashes, and the second
one is taken from the line produced by git-diff-tree.  If there is no
such line, the second ID is 0.

git-patch-id is only used by git-cherry.  git-cherry writes the second
SHA1 to some files in a temporary directory, but it never reads those
files, it only checks that they exist.

I'm pretty confident now that the patch I posted in the last message was
correct.

Of course, more cleanup will be needed to remove the second ID from
git-patch-id, to adjust git-cherry accordingly and to remove "p"
assignments in gitk.
