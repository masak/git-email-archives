It often gets used in cases where it isn't completely obvious that the 
object has already been parsed; this is the second place that it's been 
replaced.

I'd intended it to be internal, for use by things like lookup_tree(), but 
I suppose that it could be used more generally, if it got a comment that 
says that, unlike lookup_tree() and such, it returns NULL if the object 
has not already been read (because it doesn't know how to create it).
