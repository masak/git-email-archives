Well, if you do full copy detection (and break detection), then 
git-diff-tree will actually have effectively calculated the size of the 
diff of each file. It just doesn't print them (well, it does a percentage 
for the renames/copies).

So you could make git-diff-tree tell you how big the patch was, without 
actually generating a patch at all. It will be quite a bit more expensive 
than just a plain "git-diff-tree -r --name-only", but if you cache the 
result is might be quite acceptable.

Caching the result might be as simple as just telling the caching 
web-server that the result is static and never changes - no need to 
cache things inside of gitweb itself. Just set expiration to "never".

Anybody wants to add a new output format to git-diff-tree that outputs how 
big the changes are in absolute terms (rather than the "similarity index", 
which is obviously relative to the original size of the file in question)?
