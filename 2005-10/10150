This is the problem: it's impossible to download only a few objects from a 
pack file from an HTTP server, because those don't exist on the server as 
separate files.

The current HTTP code actually never downloads a pack file unless a needed 
object is not anywhere else, at which point it has no choice but to 
download the pack.
