HTTP is currently listed as a read-only/unsupported method for doing
pushes, is that due to inherent problems with HTTP or just because
it hasn't been written yet?

I've built a working prototype of an HTTP push implementation using DAV.
It locks the remote branch file during the push and PUTs to temp files to
insure nobody else reads objects while they're being pushed.  It does
not validate remote objects - if they exist on the remote end as loose
objects or in a pack, local copies won't be pushed.  It supports sparse
object directories, and verifies that the remote branch is an ancestor
of the local branch before doing anything.

I'm curious to know whether it would be useful to proceed further, and
to know what I haven't thought about yet...
