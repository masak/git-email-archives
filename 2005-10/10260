That is expected.

Although I do not follow Cogito development closely, I seem to
recall that it fetched tags without making them complete at some
point in the past; I hope it is now fixed but I am not sure.

I cannot think offhand of a way how git-push could help to cope
with a repository broken that way.  However, we could probably
have a tool that tangles from each ref, find incomplete ones and
remove them from .git/refs.  After running that maybe pull from
a know good copy would fix the broken repository.

I do not understand why removing .git/refs/tags/* did not help,
and that is the biggest thing that disturbs me in this whole
problem report.  We (meaning git-* transfer, not cg-* transfer
whose correctness I cannot vouch for) _should_ be relying only
on refs not object existence.  Maybe there are some other files
under .git/refs/ directory that had copies of them?
