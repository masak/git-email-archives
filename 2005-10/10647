Dear diary, on Wed, Oct 26, 2005 at 05:35:41AM CEST, I got a letter
where Martin Langhoff <martin.langhoff@gmail.com> told me that...

Can I then import from the CVS incrementally later? I guess from the
cvsimport code that it just tries to always import everything but the
already imported commits get the same hashes so it magically imports
"incrementally"... (The code could use some descriptive comments, it is
rather spaggetish.)

If someone really desperately needs this, BTW, you might be able to
merge two Monotone branches (.git and .cvssync) to get two-way
incremental GIT and CVS interface, and then do that through Monotone.
;-))
