It shouldn't cause any problem, unless there isn't a 4K buffer between the 
git-ssh-fetch and ssh; the fetch side would have to fill this buffer 
before getting stuck, even if ssh can't send out any more data until the 
object has been read, and 100 requests (each 21 bytes) wouldn't be enough. 
I remember that there's a lot that depends on being able to put 4K into an 
empty pipe without blocking, and I'd guess that UNIX sockets have a 
similar capacity (although I'm not going to look it up tonight).
