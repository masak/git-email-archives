As far as I'm concerned, you can remove it.

The point of show-files was to have the index update be based on the files 
that were updated, it I was originally not planning to updating the index 
directly in git-apply, but instead do something like

	files=$(git-apply --show-files)
	git-update-cache --add --delete -- $files

but it turned out to be a lot easier to just update the index.

So just remove that flag, I doubt it has ever been used.
