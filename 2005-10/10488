Dear diary, on Sun, Oct 23, 2005 at 11:41:52AM CEST, I got a letter
where Andreas Ericsson <ae@op5.se> told me that...

It would be useful to add a [PATCH] tag to subject when you submit a
patch, so that we notice it better. ;-)

You don't update the documentation even though there seem to be some
syntactic changes. You should at least update

	Documentation/pull-fetch-param.txt

Also before Junio asks you, in the followup patches, you might want to
sign off the patch if you want it integrated.

Why are you adding own compilation command, and why is it inconsistent
with the git-%$X's one?

If I understand this right,

	ssh://foo.bar:baz/quux

will make foo.bar the host and baz/quux the path. Please, do NOT do
this! It is supposed to be a URL, dammit! And you know, URLs have
defined _syntax_, and that's important at least every time the URL gets
out of GIT's context. Or stop it calling URL altogether, to prevent any
confusion. But in URLs, the space between : and / is a port definition.
See also RFC3986 (aka STD066) and RFC2718.

Thanks.

No srvside_chdir() declaration?

How portable is this? It appears that no standard really defines this,
and Google faintly hints at least some Cygwin-related problems...

What about a .h file?
