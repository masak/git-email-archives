I'm not sure what you're referring to. The one-liner is a one-liner. 
It's sort of supposed to be ugly.

Including main.h is a fairly sane option for common initialization code.

True. I'll rework it if someone thinks it's worth it.

I had some thoughts along those lines as well, especially for reading 
configuration files.

This I don't understand. Do you mean "set the progname to whatever you 
call" as in "set the progname to whatever the program author calls the 
program" or as in "set the progname to whatever it's called as from the 
command-line"?

Set the progname to whatever the author calls it then.

If so, I'd put
const char *git_progname = GIT_PROGNAME;
anywhere in the main() file and expanding the %.o: rule to include 
-DGIT_PROGNAME=\"git-$*\"

This would bark if there's a program that doesn't have it that's linked 
against something that uses it, which the setup_progname() approach 
wouldn't do.
