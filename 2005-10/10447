Btw, one additional point.

This took 0.91 seconds to complete on the current kernel history on my 
machine with a pretty much fully packed archive, and the memory footprint 
was a total of about 12MB.

And it scales pretty well too. On the historical linux archive, which is 
three years of history, the same thing takes me just over 12 seconds and 
52MB, and that's for the _whole_ history. And it's not just following one 
file: it's following that subdirectory.

So it really is pretty damn cool. 

Of course, I might have a bug somewhere, but it all _seems_ to work very 
well indeed.
