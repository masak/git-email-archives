I've been experimenting with git and gitweb, but I've reached deadend.
Maybe someone can help?


Short Version:

In sub git_get_type in gitweb.cgi, this line:
  open my $fd, "-|", "$gitbin/git-cat-file -t $hash" or return;

results in:
error: unable to find e71b869f3333ad10a492251e099ed9176248a420
fatal: git-cat-file e71b869f3333ad10a492251e099ed9176248a420: bad file

BUT, from the shell:
$ git-cat-file -t e71b869f3333ad10a492251e099ed9176248a420
commit


Longer explanation:

Initially I created the git repository using git-cvsimport as
described in the cvs-migration document.  I also installed gitweb.cgi
and everything seemed to be fine.  In particular the refs/heads/* files
referred to the tips of current branches in cvs.  I was quite pleased.

A few days later, I ran git-cvsimport again, with -i.  This imported
just the recent changes, but the view from gitweb didn't change.  :(

At first, I thought that the git-cvsimport hadn't worked.  But,
git-whatchanged clearly showed the new changes.  (I later learned that
git-rev-list also returned the tip-of-branch commits.)  After reading
gitweb.cgi, I realized that the refs/heads/* files had not been
changed, so they still referred to the tip-of-branch for the initial
import.  (I expected the refs/heads/* to point to the last commit on
each branch.  Was that wrong?)

Anyway, I tried to make a new head that actually pointed to what I
expected: 

$ echo `git-rev-list tip --max-count=1` > refs/heads/mytest
$ git-cat-file -t `cat refs/heads/mytest`
commit

No problem.  But, this same task doesn't seem to work from gitweb.cgi:

$ ./gitweb.cgi http://localhost/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=test\;a=heads > /dev/null
error: unable to find e71b869f3333ad10a492251e099ed9176248a420
fatal: git-cat-file e71b869f3333ad10a492251e099ed9176248a420: bad file

How can this be?  Have I messed something up, or am I just totally confused?
