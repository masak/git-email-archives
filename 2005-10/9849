I think we might want to have a flag that says "don't care about 
filesystem modes". That should be pretty easy, I think we'd get most of 
them by just adding some logic to "ce_match_stat()".

Then add a "git chmod" to set the mode in the index (which should end up 
being just a wrapper around the regular "git-update-index" using the 
"--cacheinfo" flag, I think).

Those parts should be trivial.

The more interesting issue is how to set the _flag_ that we should do 
this. We may have to add a config file, and it should be per-repository 
(ie something like ".git/config" or ".git/info/config"). Or do we just do 
yet another environment variable?
