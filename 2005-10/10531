Yes, that's is intentional, also the http header is overwritten, if the
webserver's default is not utf8.

Huh, not sure if it's a good idea to put that into a username,
never tried or ever seen that.

Sure, 0xf6 is the single letter 'รถ' (oe) in iso-8859.

Don't know. At best get rid of the non-ascii chars in /etc/passwd
if you don't want to get in trouble... :)

All other programs sure, should definitely use utf8.

utf8 is the one and only sane encoding if you need more than ascii chars.
Just convert everything to utf8 from your locale to your webserver and
all that pain will go away immediately. :)

Best,
