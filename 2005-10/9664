When I announced the first pre-release of my little gitfs tool back in
June[1] I didn't get much response.  (Actually, that's not quite true -- I
got zero response :-)  I've been very busy and haven't had the chance to
implement any of the big missing functionality yet, nor will I have time
for at least awhile.  Hopefully I'll have some time over the holidays to
hack on it.

However, two things HAVE changed:
  1. FUSE is now in the latest mainline kernels, so the barrier-to-entry for
     toying with it is lower now
  2. The introduction of git packs a couple months ago broke it; this is now
     fixed

Other than rebasing against git-core-0.99.8 the only major changes are:
  * now runs in non-debugging mode by default (use '-d' to enable debugging
    mode)
  * some efficiency improvements in the directory-handling code
All the limitations and caveats in the original announcement still apply.

As always --  http://www.sfgoth.com/~mitch/linux/gitfs/
