It means to "cg-seek" back to an earlier state of the repo, and forward to a
more recent state of the repo. "seeking back and forth" means doing a lot of
"cg-seek" commands. Sorry that wasn't clear.

I already use that branch.

Here's some commands that reproduce the problem:

$ mkdir tmpproj
$ cd tmpproj
$ cg-init

give the initial commit message and save

$ ls > a
$ cg-add a
$ cg-commit

give the commit message and save

$ cg-tag nodirs
$ mkdir d
$ mv a d/a
$ cg-rm a
$ cg-add d/a
$ cg-commit

give the commit message and save

$ cg-seek nodirs

now I would expect to see the original directory, with no 'd' subdirectory, and
just the 'a' file sitting there.

$ ls -F
a  d/
$

See the problem? The 'd' directory did not exist in this version of the
repository, but it's there anyway.

Be well,
Zack
