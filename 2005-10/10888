The following is not at all standard; AFAICT, I'm the only person who does 
it. But...

You can have a single repository shared between multiple working trees, by 
having the repository somewhere and making 
.git/{objects,refs,info,remotes} be symlinks to the corresponding 
directories in the repository. I've got a script to set this up, if you 
want.

The system will be unhappy if you commit to a branch that is checked out 
elsewhere (because the head of that branch will change out from under the 
checked out version), like having someone push to a repository with the 
branch checked out.

You need to think about this as there only being one repository that has 
multiple working trees, rather than having working tree/repository pairs, 
where the repositories are connected as an optimization; anything you do 
in one of the working trees will automatically affect what the others see.

This isn't official supported, but it actually works quite well, except 
that things that should be shared are occasionally added to the .git 
directory (like remotes not too long ago).
