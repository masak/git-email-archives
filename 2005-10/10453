It'd be good to clarify whether we discuss whether the idea of tracking
renames is good or bad, or whether having the user explicitly specify
renames is better than figuring that out automagically. Your first
comment would indicate the former, but the rest of your reply the
latter.

> You can follow renames _afterwards_. 

I can - crudely, but what's the point, if the user is dying to give me
the information.

It's unreliable and it's slow (well, perhaps I should get some numbers
to back that out, but given how it is done I take it for granted). Does
not sound too "very well" to me.

> I'm convinced that git handles renames better than any other SCM ever. 
> Exactly because we figure it out when it matters.

It matters at least every time you show per-file history and every time
you merge cross the rename. I think that can be both pretty common if
you ever do the rename. That means you can do an expensive guess
every time you hit that, and the guess can get it wrong, in which case
there is no way around that and you lose.
