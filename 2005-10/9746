There is another workable strategy.  Modify git-diff-xxx to report
the sha1 of the tree, or the sha1's of the files the patch applies to.
And make that information available to git-apply.  I don't how often
it would help but it has the possibility of letting the tools know
exactly what the patch applied against.

A rational for why this would work is that is that a kernel repository
is large,  and unless objects/alternatives can be made to work across
servers there will be people who can use git for development but can't
host a repository that can be pulled from.   Especially for a small
patch.

Using sha1's for context before merging should be able to give you a
whole lot more machine verifiable context with just a little bit of work.
