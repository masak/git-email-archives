If a working tree is read-only, I wonder what you are committing.

It might not be a bad idea to think about this a bit more before
actually coding.  You are moving things out of the working tree
root level, which is a valid thing to do when worrying about a
repository (or working tree) that you do not have write access
to.  We've had a fix similar to this for temporary files used by
diff commands, which moved them to $TMPDIR or something like
that.  If the working tree root level is not writable for you,
is it valid/reasonable to assume that $GIT_DIR is?  Are there
better places?  E.g. perhaps $HOME/.gittmp/?

Please do not do "{a,b,c}".  I think ksh can grok the rest of
the git-commit.sh code, but not this.
