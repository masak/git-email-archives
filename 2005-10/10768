Sounds good.  Perhaps the commit IDs should have a prefix identifying
them.

Another approach would be to use something slightly more elaborate than
a pipe.  If I understand correctly, the commit ID would be already known
from the git-rev-list output.  Passing commit IDs through patch-id
without actually doing anything with them seems non-elegant.  Maybe we
could teach git-patch-id (or another script) to get patches by commit-id
instead of using stdin?
