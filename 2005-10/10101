Sorry, but this is not a description of your problem helpful
enough for someone who is willing to look at it, I am afraid.
http://www.kernel.org/ has 80 or so repos (I counted about a
month ago so it may probably have more by now) --- which ones?

I have local repositories used only to test pulling into them,
and I pull from Linus 2.6 kernel, and my own git repository,
every other day or so, but haven't seen breakage, so I do not
think it is http://www.kernel.org/. in general.  If some
particular repository is not set up HTTP friendly I would
understand.

Also how does it fail?  Does cloning from scratch succeed but
updating a repo that was in sync a few days ago fail?  Does it
die silently and you find the breakage by running fsck-object,
or does it fail loudly with error messages?  If the latter what
does it say?
