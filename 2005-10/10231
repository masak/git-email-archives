In this case, yes.

But In a mixed environment where you might have "bare" repositories, you 
want to have "reponame.git" as the repository name.

So with the rule that (a) try to first append ".git" and (b) then, after a 
successful chdir, try to go in one more level, you can handle both types, 
without ever having to care whether it's checked-out or not.

And for secondary projects (where git isn't necessarily the primary source 
control method), I actually use the "project.git" naming just to make it 
obvious that this is the "gitified" version of the project.

For example, I keep both my private uemacs and pine source trees as git 
repositories these days, and I have them under "~/src/uemacs.git/" and 
"~/src/pine.git/" even though they are checked out and thus actually have 
another ".git" inside of them.
