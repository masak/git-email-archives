I've somewhat updated git-rev-list documentation and tried to
categorize the options into commit selectors and presentation
modifiers.  The documentation for commands you mentioned in your
message all talk about them describing only frequently used
options, and refer the user to rev-list documentation.  I am not
sure this would be enough.

One good thing to have would be to add a section to Tutorial.
Currently we cover building a small project from scratch and
have the readers graduate when they learn basic commit swapping,
but we do not talk much about archaeology tools.
