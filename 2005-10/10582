You can have a look at the tlacontrib project scripts (I can forward
them to you since you would need tla/baz to clone/checkout the project
and this procedure is a combination of 'tag' and 'get' commands). They
automatically generate the commands together with the options and are
later used in completion.

Of course, your approach would work as well but it requires more
maintance.

When you think it is ready, I'm happy to include it (though I would
prefer a more dynamic approach like the tla one but since I don't have
time for it I'll just use yours).

Thanks.
