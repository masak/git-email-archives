Dear diary, on Sun, Oct 23, 2005 at 05:57:51PM CEST, I got a letter
where Horst von Brand <vonbrand@inf.utfsm.cl> told me that...

Well, yes, that's one of the "unhandled merge cases". :-)

To fixup:

	<resolve the merge somehow, probably adding greet in some form>
	cg-add greet

(You should be able to cg-rm greet instead if you decide to drop the
file after all.)

This is a _trick_ and it works just because cg-add and cg-rm purely
accidentally do the right GIT commands to also resolve an index-level
merge conflict. The proper solution would be to add the proper case to
cg-Xmergefile, which should be actually pretty easy, if only someone
does it... ;-)

Ok, and cg-status should be taught about it and report "greet" somehow
as a conflict until you choose one of the versions.
