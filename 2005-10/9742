That makes sense, given that you know better than the tool can
possibly guess, especially from the performance point of view.

What's interesting is that from the correctness point of view,
it should not make that much of a difference which base tree
happens to be picked -- if the base tree is wildly different
from your current HEAD, most of that wild difference will be
carried over intact to the result of patch application for paths
and parts of the files the patch does not touch.  Three-way
merge notices that and your "changes" from the base tree win.

Thanks.  So in short, you do not even need '-c' option, but just
trim the mbox you feed to applymbox and re-run it.

While I was experimenting with the git-am (only in 'pu' branch,
and still marked as "do not use"), I noticed that it does the
right thing on an already applied patch.  It fails to apply,
finds an appropriate base and then notices the result of the
patch application is already contained in the HEAD ;-).
