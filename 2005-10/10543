Hmm.. Yes, that's a good point. I don't see what thing could do it that we 
care about (and since we do actually do a pretty valid ctype 
implementation, it should all work out right regardless), but yes, it 
might be safer to rename the things.

Especially if we then continue to make sure _not_ to include <ctype.h> 
ourselves, so that only systems with broken headers (like the ones on 
OpenBSD ;) could ever use the standard names anyway. That way we'd not 
have to worry whether somebody uses them by mistake..

Btw, nobody ever replied to my question whether we might be using 
something else that is locale-specific. I'm not actually locate-aware 
enough to even know what else than <ctype.h> might be dangerous to use..

Anybody?
