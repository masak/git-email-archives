Actually, I'm thinking of quitting that because I'm actually more likely 
to realize I need to add something when I see it in the untracked list 
than any other time. Now that the untracked list is right there, I 
probably won't bother to think about it until that point. That is, the new 
feature makes my old habit unnecessary. (I obviously don't care what other 
people do; I'm still using multiple working trees with the same 
repository, which AFAIK nobody else has done for months.)

For that matter, it helps, if I find I've done two things that I want to 
commit separately in the same working tree if the first commit doesn't 
have to include the addition of all the new files.

Looks like what I was thinking, yes.
