Oh. I thought it was so I would know how much data would be sent over 
the network. Diskspace is cheap, bandwidth is... well, that's cheap too 
(in Sweden at least), but it's boring to wait.

 From my du man-page:

  -k     like --block-size=1K

I think *most* du implementations work like this, but apparently not all 
of them. I'll hack something up in C instead so it's at least consistent 
regardless of what version of du is used.
