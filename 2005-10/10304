Are you getting a curl return code of 52/CURLE_GOT_NOTHING?  Any chance
you have access to the associated server logs?

In the situation you describe, fetch() won't be called for the second
object until fetch() for the first object is finished - at which point
the pack will have been fully downloaded for the first object (or
failed, causing fetch() for the first object to fail as well.)
