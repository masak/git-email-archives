I'm getting 404 for the object, which it reports. This was pulling from 
kernel.org.

My theory is that you have: prefetch(#2), prefetch(#1), (other stuff), #1 
gives an error, start downloading the pack, fetch(#2), #2 gives an error, 
and there are no more packs to try.

That is, it was a later object that prompted getting the pack, because 
either the server decided to send that error message sooner, some packet 
got dropped and retransmitted, the connection got a lower-numbered file 
descriptor and they were ready at the same time, or something like that.

Another thing I noticed was that it was in the middle of downloading the 
pack when it suddenly exitted due to not being able to find the object; it 
would probably be worth having a call to finish up the active transfers 
after giving up on completing the whole thing, since we probably do 
actually want to finish downloading a big pack if we've started.

Consider the situation where you happen to catch the server in the middle 
of mirroring, and you're halfway through a big pack; restarting is nice, 
but it might as well let you finish downloading the pack, so you have less 
to do when you try again later.
