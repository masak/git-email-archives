Yeah, some people write lousy commit subjects.  But me?  Nooo,
/never/.  :)

I'll look into that, but the cost wasn't in the image; it was in the
width calculation.

Here's a side-by-side comparison.  Open two browser tabs and flip between them:

http://www.codesifter.com/cgi-bin/gitweb-difftreeP.cgi?p=git.git;a=shortlog
http://www.codesifter.com/cgi-bin/gitweb-difftreeNames.cgi?p=git.git;a=shortlog

I've used a project you all are familar with, and that has more than
two files.  The first page uses 'git-diff-tree -p $hash|wc -l'.  The
second page uses 'git-diff-tree -r --name-only|wc -l'.  (Oh and I have
a merge indicator now.)

How do they compare for showing damage-potential?  I think they both
do a reasonable job.  I think the full patch diff is a bit better, but
it does cost.
