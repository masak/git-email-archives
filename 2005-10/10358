Anyone noticed that either of those schemes aren't actually 
backward-compatible in any way (old client talking to new server will be 
disconnected), and that unfortunately is the best thing one can do with 
the current setup, exactly because there is no option negotiation phase?

Another issue is that currently there is no error information propagated 
back to the client; the server logs an error in its own logs, but the 
client is simply disconnected.
