I do not think git-diff-tree -p output can have 40-byte
hexadecimal at the beginning of the output anywhere other than
commit object names; why clutter output?

Sorry you lost me.  I am not sure what you mean by "without
actually doing anything" part.  The input to patch-id command in
the above pipe is (commit-object-name patch)*.  The command
reads such a stream, and transforms it to a (patch-id
commit-object-name)* stream.  In other words, the input
identifies each patch with a commit-object-name, and the command
condenses each patch to a patch-id, and spits them out, labelled
with commit-object-name.
