Dear diary, on Sat, Oct 22, 2005 at 04:10:59AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Well, it's obviously unflying idea when it doesn't become core part of
GIT. ;-) That won't stop me with Cogito, though...

The thing is, you aren't supposed to have a lot of grafts, they are
expected to be rare. OTOH, renames aren't really all that rare, and as
the history goes, you'll accumulate a lot of them. Besides, it's not
just a cache - in case the user manually recorded the rename, it's an
important historical information, as important as e.g. the commit
message. It should be also distributed with the rest of the history
data, not be a per-repository thing. (Actually, this does not mix with
the cache at all - that should be a separate thing, quite possibly in
info/.)


But if GIT won't do this, I will have to do this in some Cogito-specific
way. My preliminary plan is appending something like this to the commit
message:

	---
	!%$rename foo\x20bar baz\nquux

!%$ being some arbitrary magic literal, and filter this out from cg-log
and such. Also, all Cogito commits adding/removing files but not
renaming any would have a '!%$norenames' line in the commit message, so
that I know that I don't have to do the expensive heuristics because no
rename/copy happened.
