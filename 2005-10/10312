Something similar was reported yesterday, and when I investigated I
found that one of the kernel.org servers was returning a 404 for the
object in question and the other wasn't.  Vger bounced my reply because
it contained Content-type: headers...

I could see that happen if the pack appeared on the repo after #1 404ed
and subsequently decided there were no packs, and before #2 404ed.  Or,
as was the case I saw yesterday, servers with the same DNS name aren't
in sync.  However, the pack download for #2 should never start in that
case because fetch() for #1 would fail and exit.

I'm not sure how that could happen - once a pack download request
starts, it has to finish before any fetch() calls can fail.  However,
there could certainly be other object requests in process when one
fails, and it would be polite to let them finish.
