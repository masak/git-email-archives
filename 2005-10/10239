Consider the whitelist/blacklist scenario I described in the previous 
email.  You have:

whitelist:	/pub/scm
blacklist:	/pub/scm/foo/bar.git

If you can bypass the blacklist by using the pathname /pub/scm/foo/bar, 
that's bad.

The only reason to do that is to make it less likely that a future 
programmer would screw it up.
