Btw, if it wasn't obvious, this is also required to keep files and revs 
separate.

I don't think we have anything that cares right now, but I'm working on 
trying to get "git-rev-list" to limit its output to the files given on the 
command line, and then I want to be able to do

	gitk -- rev-list.c

and in my version of git-rev-list, the "--" is required to separate out 
the revs from the names (since otherwise it's just too error-prone).

That requires that git-rev-parse not only honor "--", but pass it through 
when the output can contain both revs/flags _and_ filenames.
