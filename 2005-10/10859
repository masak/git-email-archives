Are you sure you just don't have an old version of git on the other end?

As far as I know, git-unpack-objects will use the bog-standard 
"write_sha1_file()" which already knows how to create missing 
subdirectories.

This _sounds_ like the other end has two different versions of git, and 
when you "push" to it, it executes an old version, but then you have a 
newer version somewhere that created the sparsely-populated object 
directory in the first place.

This happens (for example) if you have installed an older version of git 
through an rpm (say, the one that comes from Fedora Core: 0.99.8) and you 
have that in /usr/bin, but then you have a newer version that you've built 
and installed yourself in your ~/bin/ directory.

If you have your PATH being set in your .bashrc, it won't trigger with a
non-interactive login, so you'll use the /usr/bin/ version when pushing, 
but then when you log in interactively to a shell, you'll use the ~/bin 
one (or the other way around, I'm easily confused by the bash config file 
rules ;)
