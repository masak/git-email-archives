Ok -- I seem to be wrong in blaming PPC, so it's back to cg-fetch, and
I think I have a patch that does the right thing.

To recap: repo is slightly broken because cg-fetch has fetched tag
objects, but hasn't followed them through to the commit objects they
refer to.

Internally cg-fetch is actually using git-ssh-fetch (I misreported it
using git-fetch-pack), which is working correctly. However, cg-fetch
attempts to optimize the fetch process, by not calling git-ssh-fetch
if it has the tagobj that the ref points to. How those tag objects get
there without commits in the first place I don't know. So I've removed
the optimization and life is much better.

There is a second bug during the tag fetch. Some of the references
(created by git-cvsimport) are multiline, and break cg-fetch. It's
probably a bug in git-cvsimport, but I'm fixing cg-fetch to use head
-n1 instead of cat. I'll deal with git-cvsimport later.

On this broken-ish repo, git-fetch-pack segfaults as I've reported.
Running it under strace shows that it dies walking the local repo,
trying to find a missing commit. Unlikely that this is PPC only ;-)

cheers,
