Side note: "safe in practice" isn't necessarily the same as "safe in 
theory".

I think that strictly speaking, if you include <ctype.h>, the "isxxxx()" 
format is always reserved (where "x" is lowercase letters), and in theory 
you could have a compiler that recognizes them even before the 
pre-processor as being something built-in.

In _practice_, such a compiler would be incredibly broken (it would have 
to do the recognition after preprocessing too), and I doubt you'd ever see 
such a thing, but from a pure language-lawyer standpoint it might 
technically be possible.

However, I'm surprised that you see <ctype.h> at all. The OpenBSD headers 
seem to be including <ctype.h> from <sys/poll.h>, which doesn't make any 
sense. It may not be strictly against POSIX, but it's definitely strange 
and bad form to do unnecessary name pollution that the user didn't ask 
for.

So git actually tries to be pretty good about things. Not only does it try 
to handle any existing system <ctype.h> by doing the #undef, it actually 
doesn't include the system ctype.h at _all_ when it includes "cache.h". 
And OpenBSD is being a bit strange.
