I've now started getting errors from http-fetch; my guess for the output 
is that it has problems if an object is not available loose, and is only 
available in a pack file which is already being downloaded for a different 
object, possibly only if the first request to be made for the loose 
object is not the first one to fail.

On the other hand, it looks like just trying again works fine (or, at 
least, makes progress), so there's no need to fall back to rsync or such.

But that also means that, in order to try to make a repeatable test, you 
need to copy your state before you run it and get the error; I'll probably 
try this evening to work it out.
