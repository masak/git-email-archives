Interesting.

As you say, I'm obviously testing on ppc all the time, and if 
git-fetch-pack has problems on ppc, I haven't seen them. And I fetch a 
lot.

It might be just the repo you're using. I can't test, since I obviously 
cannot ssh into the repo you pointed at (I tried to see if you had a 
git-daemon running, but no such luck).

Even more interesting than strace might be for you to try to run 
git-send-pack (even on an x86) under valgrind. valgrind really is a 
wonderful tool.

One other potential issue: I'm not running debian. I've run YDL, but right 
now the machine I use is FC4. There are likely _lots_ of library 
differences etc there.
