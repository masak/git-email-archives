If we wanted to make this work reliably, we could have a 
"LAST_CHECKED_OUT" which has an actual hash (rather than being a link like 
HEAD is), and gets set by the checkout. Then it would always know what 
commit you have checked out, even if something causes HEAD to not match.

I personally just never have the same branch checked out twice, so the 
situation doesn't happen to me. It's easy enough to add additional 
branches.

Oh, that reminds me: is there a simple way to merge a branch with another 
local branch or remote branch that's already up-to-date? E.g., I've 
already fetched the latest git from kernel.org, built it, and installed 
it. Now I want to merge my development branch with that. Last time I was 
looking, I had to write the message for the merge myself, unlike "pull", 
which takes care of that.

Also, I have a repository on my server for one of my projects. I push from 
my workstation to the "mainline" branch, and I have "deploy" checked out 
(with some configuration changes that shouldn't propagate back). Then I 
merge "mainline" into "deploy", build, and install. Same thing; I have to 
write the "merge with mainline" argument myself.
