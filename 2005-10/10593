I am not saying that using UTF-8 is impossible in some
situations.  I am saying that if all involved parties agree to
use something else in a private project, that is their choice
and there is no reason to forbid it.  They may be shooting in
the foot in the long run, they may be not.

For the internal project I was using as an example, I do not
forsee anybody who does not do Japanese ever touching it, nor it
needs to record any other language in the future (this comes
from the nature of the project -- keeping track of some
documents that are written in Japanese and we are not in
translation business).  Log and contents being encoded in EUC-JP
is perfectly valid right now and in the future in that project.
In such an application there is nothing gained by using UTF-8,
and it will only inconvenience the users if we insisted on
UTF-8.
