Dear diary, on Mon, Oct 17, 2005 at 02:48:09AM CEST, I got a letter
where "Martin Langhoff (CatalystIT)" <martin@catalyst.net.nz> told me that...

I'm sorry but I will not be there - it is too far away from my little
country. :-(

(i) You might want to say "cg-export" instead of "git-tar-tree" (*shrug*)

(ii) You say:

	- Very fast stupid merge
	    ... and very smart, slow merges when stupid won't do

  What are you explicitly referring to? I don't think any kind of merge
in GIT (unless something totally missed me) can be called "very smart".
If it's a three-way merge, it's never "very smart".

(iii) I have only one major problem with your file:

	emacs .gitignore

  This should be obviously:

	vim .gitignore

;-)

Not me. Perhaps I'm in some VIP class. :^)
