I think git-daemon would be better off without this, since
* A project rarely grants write access to the central repo (or whatever 
git has, I'm still fairly new to it) without being willing to give out 
ssh access, often limited by the ssh command whitelist.
* It's hard to do right.
* Passwords are never as secure or as convenient as public key 
authentication and there's no point in spending a lot of time 
re-inventing ssh.
