This does two things:

 - we don't allow "." and ".." as components of a refname. Thus get_sha1() 
   will not accept "./refname" as being the same as "refname" any more.

 - git-rev-parse stops doing revision translation after seeing a pathname, 
   to match the brhaviour of all the tools (once we see a pathname, 
   everything else will also be parsed as a pathname).

Basically, if you did

	git log *

and "gitk" was somewhere in the "*", we don't want to replace the filename 
"gitk" with the SHA1 of the branch with the same name.

Of course, if there is any change of ambiguity, you should always use "--" 
to make it explicit what are filenames and what are revisions, but this 
makes the normal cases sane. The refname rule also means that instead of 
the "--", you can do the same thing we're used to doing with filenames 
that start with a slash: use "./filename" instead, and now it's a 
filename, not an option (and not a revision).

So "git log ./*.c" is now actually a perfectly valid thing to do, even if 
the first C-file might have the same name as a branch.

Trivial test:

	git-rev-parse gitk ./gitk gitk

should output something like

	9843c3074dfbf57117565f6b7c93e3e6812857ee
	./gitk
	gitk

where the "./gitk" isn't seen as a revision, and the second "gitk" is a 
filename simply because we've seen filenames already, and thus stopped 
doing revision parsing.

----

I like my "ambiguous_path()" function. Now, admittedly it thinks that 
".../" is also an ambigious path since it doesn't count the dots. But 
since we already don't like ".." inside refnames, we don't much care.
