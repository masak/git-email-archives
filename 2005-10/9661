I talk about configuration per remote repository vs. configuration per
local head, and a consistent user interface regarding these.

Cogito is using configuration per head: If there is a remote fetch mapping,
this is stored in branches/<headname>. There is no new shortcut to
remember, because every file in branches corresponds to a local head.

On the other hand, a remotes/<remote> file is configuration per remote 
repository, and it introduces a new shortname <remote> for a repository, 
which by itself has nothing to do with a head name.

You look for a file in branches/ if there is nothing in remotes/.
I think this is quite confusing for newbies, and blurs the understanding
of remotes/ files, as a file name in branches/ (which is a existing head),
and the file name in remotes/ (which is an arbitrary choosen shortcut for a 
remote repository) are quite different things.

If GIT makes use of per-remote-repository only (as it is now), I
suggest getting rid of parsing branches/. Cogito can do its
per-head configuration in addition/layered on top of GITs 
per-remote-repository configuration, e.g. by refering to a repository
shortcut name in its files in branches/.

No. It is about specifying local head names only, without remote.
Please forget for the moment the current command lines, and
and suppose it is about

	$ git-fetch <localhead>

Given per-head configuration for <localhead>, the <remote> would
be already available (in branches/<localhead>); it does not
need to be specified at all. And a

	$ git-fetch <localhead1> <localhead2> ...

would potentially fetch from different remote repositories.
The nice thing here is that without a head, you can use the
current HEAD as default.

I do not advocate to change this in GIT at all; but what about
git-fetch-head/git-pull-head/git-push-head ?

This even would be the wrong behavior: cg-clone creates local <origin>
head, branches off <master>, and checks out <master>. So when running
cg-push afterwards, you are in fact on the <master> branch, and there
is no remote specified for <master>. Cogito
currently is hardcoded to push to the remote head specified in <origin>
when on <master>.

I suggested Pasky to get rid of this hardcoding, support a "Push:"
line in branches/ files, and create a branches/master in cg-clone.
Similar, a configuration to specify the relation of origin and master
is missing.

Then, to be correct, you would have to use the remote head
in the "Push:" line of the current HEAD.

No. We can not do this, as Cogito currently only stores half of its
behavior in configuration files.

If you really want to still parse branches/ files, perhaps it would be
better to create a remotes/ file the first time after parsing it, and
give out a warning that a new repository shortcut was created, to be
used with git-pull etc.

I still think it is wrong to use one head name of a repository as the
default for the repository's name.
