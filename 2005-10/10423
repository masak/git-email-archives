Dear diary, on Fri, Oct 21, 2005 at 07:31:31AM CEST, I got a letter
where Martin Langhoff <martin@catalyst.net.nz> told me that...

I'd prefer the approach to throw away the tag. Otherwise we get into
problems when we want to grab only a single branch from multi-branch
repository.

>  + if the tagref points to a blob and we have it, it'll skip it

The problem is that the ^{blob} syntax is not in 0.98, so this would
make Cogito depend on a yet unreleased GIT version, which is
troublesome.

So I guess this patch will end up in my post-0.99/1.0 queue for now.
But by that time, this part of cg-fetch will be probably already totally
rewritten. ;-)

I'm still thinking about it. I will certainly try to at least somehow
reuse git-fetch's remote parser, if not anything else - reimplementing
that would be just stupid.
