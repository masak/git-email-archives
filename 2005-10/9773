OK.  Your /etc/.git is writable by you but /etc is not.
Although I personally would do it a bit differently (my /etc
sources would live in a different area which is a source tree
and 'make install' as root would install the latest to /etc; no
need for anything user writable under /etc, including
/etc/.git/), I do not think your set-up is wrong -- we should
support it.

I changed my mind about this.  $GIT_DIR by definition should be
writable by you since we are talking about committing -- I think
moving them to $GIT_DIR/ is a good change.
