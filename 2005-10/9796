I'll have to check, but I think it's 7.9.8 or close to that; it seems like 
they added multi support without a critical function, so you might need to 
bump the check from what the history would suggest.

It's line 168 of fetch.c; the "!has_sha1_file(obj->sha1)" part should go 
away.

That looks good. I think it might be good to set the default connection 
limit higher; I don't think we can generate enough parallelism that we'd 
cause problems for a server with a single client, and, with a constant 
stream of clients, this will just shuffle around when the connections 
happen; to the extent that a single client does more simultaneous 
connections, it'll overlap less with other clients.

The other things that affect the behaviour of the HTTP fetch in particular 
are done as environment variables, which seems like a good idea to me. 
Alternatively, you could use a long option. I don't expect there will be 
much variation in what someone uses.
