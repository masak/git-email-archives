Thanks, that is good to know.  As I said in another message, I
looked at cg-fetch's current tag completion code while working
on the ref^{tree} thing, and saw it used commit walker with '-a'
option (IOW, not producing an incomplete tag) to download
everything.

Even after fetch-pack segfaulted, since it does not update any
refs itself (it only writes them to stdout for the wrapper to
process), it should not have resulted in the repository that has
refs pointing at objects it does not have. In fact, it writes
its "SHA1 - name" list only after seeing unpack-objects exit
successfully, that should not have resulted in a corrupt
repository that records incomplete refs.  I suspect there is
something else going on here.

In cg-fetch, fetch-pack is used only in one location, and it
does not have anything to do with the tag completion code.
Presumably that explains why removing tags did not have any
effect, although it does not explain why removing some objects
did -- maybe those object files you needed to remove were
corrupt?
