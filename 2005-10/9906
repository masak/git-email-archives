And yes, I made my first patch with git today!  But I cut-n-pasted
it and blew the leading tabs.

Related question.  I created "mybranch" to do the patch, but how
can I have my repository now forget that mybranch was ever made?
Is it sufficient to remove the branch link, and then type some "fsck"
operation?

That's also a question in general... how can I remove a commit,
knowing that I'd never refer to it again?  Or is disk space so cheap
that it wouldn't make any difference anyway?
