Indeed I wish we could see the set of refs you had and output
from fsck-objects before the failed git-pull and after.

One thing I am aware of is that cogito repository at kernel.org
is not set up to be HTTP friendly -- it lacks info/refs file
git-clone uses for discovery of the available refs.

Cogito's clone/fetch over HTTP uses recursive wget for
discovery, and I presume that is one of the reasons nobody
noticed this.  Another reason may probably be that more people
use rsync transport.
