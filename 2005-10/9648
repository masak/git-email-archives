I personally hate it.

It adds horrible patches to fairly core stuff, all because the prefetching 
is not limited.

As far as I can tell, it should be much easier to just limit the 
prefetching to some reasonable limit (say, a few objects deep), which 
guarantees that the prefetching doesn't fill up the write queues on the 
fetching side.

It's not like prefetching improves performance once you get to the point 
where you can stream. I suspect having more than two or three objects "in 
flight" really only helps with

 - lots of small objects
 - high latency
 - high bandwidth

and the thing is, high latency together with high bandwidth is really 
quite uncommon - usually high latency goes along with _low_ bandwidth (the 
one exception is things like satellite links, which can have latencies in 
the seconds, even with good throughput).

It should be pretty easy to benchmark, but my _suspicion_ is that limiting 
the read-ahead to even just five is likely to get you 99% of the way, and 
that the performance impact of going higher is very limited.

(It might need some extra code to make the synchronous receiving side 
re-start the prefetching if the prefetching has stopped after a few 
entries - but at that point the extra code is where it is supposed to be, 
rather than having core code work around problems in the fetching. I also 
suspect that the prefetch limiting can happily be done in the generic 
"pull" code, rather than separately for each protocol, so it would need to 
be done in just one place).
