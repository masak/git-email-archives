  Hello,

Dear diary, on Wed, Oct 19, 2005 at 10:00:46AM CEST, I got a letter
where Nico -telmich- Schottelius <nico-linux-git@schottelius.org> told me that...
> The following situation:
> 
> - The last commit was a merge, mhich broke some files
> - We want three files from the commit before
..snip..
> Is this really the standard way to recover a file? As a developer / end user I would expect that:

> cg-recover <filename> <commit id> and -f for overwriting the file if it exists

  thanks for the suggestion. I've revamped cg-restore to support this
kind of syntax, so now if you do

	cg-restore -r ID [-f] FILENAME

it should do what you want.
