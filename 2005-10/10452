I disagree.

Every single thing that said that renames were a bad idea to track when 
git started is still equally true.

Never. I'm 100% convinced that tracking renames is WRONG WRONG WRONG.

You can follow renames _afterwards_. 

Git tracks contents. And I think we've proven that figuring out renames 
after-the-fact from those contents is not only doable, but very well 
supported already.

I'm convinced that git handles renames better than any other SCM ever. 
Exactly because we figure it out when it matters.
