True, but it should not be a problem that is made harder for you
to solve by the fact that our repository is not based on weaves.

Unless an weave-based SCM comes with an integrated editor that
records line insertion and deletion user actions and forces
users to use that editor and nothing else, it also has to work
on two whole files (pre- and post-modification) in order to find
the matching lines and figure out the weave to record, on top of
the history before pre-modification image.  I think you have the
same information as they have to create the weave after the fact
for each commit in that sense.
