I don't know about this.  Saying we only support ASCII tagnames can be 
quote brutal for non-English-language projects.  Even with the set 
above, we'd at the very least need underscore, and I know of at least 
one project which require # in tagnames.  In short, I don't think we can 
make that decision for people.

We can disallow whitespace, and we *have* to disallow at least newline 
due to the file format; I believe we should disallow all control 
characters (0-31, 127-159.)
