Ok, that's not horribly surprising, but it's wrong.

Since I'm a lazy bastard, and couldn't necessarily re-create the right 
kind of broken repository even if I weren't, could you just enable 
core-dumps, and run gdb on the thing and report what "where" says is the 
call-chain.

It's almost certainly something that looks up an object and dereferences 
it without checking whether the object lookup succeeded or not. But if you 
can say where the SIGSEGV happens, it will be easier to figure out where.

Of course, what I really _should_ do is improve "sparse" to the point 
where I can mark functions as returning "unsafe" pointers, and then have 
sparse statically find all the dangerous users. I should do that anyway, 
since it would be useful for the kernel too, but it's actually quite 
nontrivial.
