Dear diary, on Wed, Oct 19, 2005 at 08:02:14AM CEST, I got a letter

I agree that we should definitely use timeout instead of some low speed
limit - can't curl do that?

But 30 seconds is too little (on bad links, I've seen TCP connections
stalled for much longer), I would use at least 120 seconds. Or perhaps
30 seconds, but retry three times or so.
