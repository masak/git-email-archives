Of course, but that's not the issue.  isspace treats its parameter as if
it had been converted from unsigned char to int.  If char is signed,
Ã¯sspace will mistreat those characters that have a negative value.
Then again, I don't think a space character, one that the C locale
regards as such, anyway, wiill ever have a negative value, so the issue
is rather academic.

Quite true.  One reason I tend to avoid the standard is* functions in my
own code.
