This patch _may_ work. I've not tested it a lot. Surprise surprise.

NOTE! This has some seriously far-reaching implications. One of them is 
that a few programs will automagically start working inside some random 
directories.

And probably others won't. Instead of saying "Not a git archive", they 
might run and do strange things.

The patch is definitely a big step in the right direction: it makes the 
shell scripts that include "git-sh-setup" act a lot more like the programs 
that automatically find the git directory. But everybody that includes 
git-sh-setup should be verified.

This fixes gitk to also work the same way, btw.

Testing needed. Lots of it.
