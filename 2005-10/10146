Is this one of the hooks we ship as examples?  If so, that
means worse brokenness than just test failing.  It means that
the hook is not usable in your environment.

I presume it is this line in pre-commit sample hook:

    open $fh, "-|", qw(git-diff-index -p -M --cached HEAD);

Is Perl on Cygwin incapable of handle this in general, or is it
just what is on your machine being behind?

In the meantime, I've changed two things:

 - Earlier, tests run in a trash/ repository that was
   initialized with user's random templates.  This was *wrong*.
   It now uses freshly built templates that came from the
   source.

 - Further, hooks are disabled in the trash/ repository used for
   tests.  When we later add tests for hooks (HINTS, anybody
   ;-)), they can add their own anyway.
