Which probably means it's time for me to generate a patch to the
git-whatchanged documentation.

Maybe.

After thinking about it I don't think you need to look through the
history to use it for a merge3 operation.   As I recall merge3 only
looks at the base and the two derived versions of the file.  If we
have the sha1 of the original in the git repository I think all we
need to compute is the diff between that sha1 the current version
file.  And then apply the merge3 algorithm to combine the two sets of
changes.
