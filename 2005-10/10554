I often do "git add something" when I happen to think of it, not 
necessarily right before committing, which means that I have these files 
changed in my index while working. I may quit this, however, now that git 
status lists the ones I missed.

Incidentally, the new git status entry for --others really ought to say 
something different from "Ignored files", like "Exist but not tracked", 
since it doesn't include the contents of .gitignore, which you'd expect to 
be "Ignored". (And, of course, any files it lists are hardly being 
ignored.)
