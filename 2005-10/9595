This makes "git-update-index" avoid the new index file write if it didn't 
make any changes to the index.

It still doesn't make things like "git status" be read-only operations in 
general, but if the index file doesn't need refreshing, it now will at 
least avoid making unnecessary changes.

This only makes sense after applying my previous patch, since otherwise a 
"--refresh" will always end up marking the index dirty anyway.

Also, while I tried to verify that we always mark the index dirty when we 
change it, I can't guarantee it. In particular, since we now map the index 
file with PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, somebody can modify the index entries in 
place without getting a SIGSEGV.

Originally you couldn't do the modify-in-place, and used to be that you 
could depend on the active_cache[] being unmodified only by actually 
assigning to the pointer array itself.

I don't think git-update-index writes to the entries directly, though 
(git-read-tree does, but it doesn't do the optimization).
