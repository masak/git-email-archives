Note that git-patch-id will happily take a patch without the commit ID at 
the head, it just won't have a commit ID to match it up with. For such 
patches it will just spit it out with an all-zero commit-object-name.

And that's very much by design. The point is that you can match up your 
(perhaps non-git) patches with what has been accepted. Which is why 
git-patch-id should always take non-git patches too, and then you can 
match them up by sorting by patch ID and doing "join -1" to match up 
duplicates.

So git-patch-id will work with or without the commit ID, but the commit ID 
is then later needed to figure out _which_ commit you matched up.
