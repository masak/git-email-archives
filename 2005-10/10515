Yes, I know that as the one who did the convention between
git-merge and merge strategy backends.  The convention feeds two
(or more) heads and the common ancestors git-merge already
figured out to the strategy backends.

The current callers only feed commits for "$heads" parameters,
so the merge strategy backends are free to figure out the common
ancestor or even generate weave on the fly, but an unwritten
rule was that strategy backends are expected to do something
sensible even when the "common ancestors" and "heads" fed to
them are tree objects, which was my comment about 3-way was
about.
