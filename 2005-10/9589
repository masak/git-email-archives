Well, it's not corrupted, but yes, the index file ends up unreadable.

The umask thing looks like a bug. Fixed thus.

Also, arguably we should try to avoid writing the index file when not 
necessary, although the fact is, that cg-status (and "git status") _do_ 
need to actually keep it up-to-date in order to do the right thing. Also 
true of some other programs that might otherwise appear to be read-only 
(ie I've considered doing the same thing for "git diff").

We used to have that optimization, but it was broken. I fixed it but 
disabled it for fear of other bugs.

But honoring umask would seem to be a no-brainer.
