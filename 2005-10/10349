Dear diary, on Thu, Oct 20, 2005 at 08:11:17AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

What's wrong with my scheme? That is, _reply_ with challenge to the
upload-pack command. This should be equally powerful to the Linus'
scheme and the crucial advantage is that you do not need to tell at
the client side whether you are talking to a new server or an old one.

I was convinced that the authentication part of the challenge-resposne
isn't such a good idea after all, though. ;-)
