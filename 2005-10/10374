No. 

What you _must_ do to fix things up is that _you_ merge your current head 
with your old head, and then you push out the result.

At that point:

You should have a (C) that is the merge of both A and B (or a later 
commit, if you have other commits merged).

Now you can push out that merge, and everybody will be happy again: 
they'll see somethign that is a proper superset of whichever HEAD they 
happened to pull.

Don't make everybody else try to fix up your mistakes for you. It's easy 
enough for you to just fix it up, and everybody else can just pull.

Of course, anybody who did a pull and then did the merge by hand will 
always have their own private merge, and they should probably just undo 
that. But undoing _private_ stuff is ok.
