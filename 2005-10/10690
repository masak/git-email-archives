What is that about?

I'm hoping to get back to gitk hacking RSN - I've been going flat out
on the ppc32/ppc64 merge.  Thanks for doing the --dense thing; I was
thinking about doing something like that inside gitk but doing it in
git-rev-list is better.  It does mean that I now want to be able to
get gitk to contract the view to just a given set of files or
directories and then expand back to the whole tree view, which means
running git-rev-list multiple times, which gitk can't do at the
moment...

Paul.
