OH!  You, sir, DO have a crystal ball.  :) 

I foolishly assumed that the second time I ran git-cvsimport, with -C
/pub/scm/project/ it would be able to detect that I was using the
stand-alone GIT-DIR.  But, it obviously didn't.  I guess the solution
is use specify GIT_DIR everytime I run git-cvstimport.

So, it seems that git-web.cgi detects and prefers the stand-alone
directory structure, because I specify it in the projects_list file,
while git-cat-file, and git-update-ref default to using .git.

Ah, and if I'd used that command, I would have realized something was
wrong when mytest *didn't* appear in refs/heads, but rather
.git/refs/heads.

Thanks for thinking creatively about how I could have messed it up!
