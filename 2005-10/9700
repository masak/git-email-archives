Correct. 

What I usually do is to just ignore the split patches, and go back to the 
mbox. Delete the ones that applied, and look at the one that didn't. Then 
I try to apply that one manually - sometimes I actually do a quick manual 
branch to a known version, apply and merge - and I think I might try to 
use the "base wiggle" patch for that. Although I would actually prefer to 
be able to try against a specific named release (not "all named tags" 
first).

Quite often, the reason it doesn't apply is that I already have that patch 
through a git merge (or because I applied that patch earlier through 
another person), in which case I don't even try to merge it, I just delete 
that email too, and just do "git-applymbox" again.
