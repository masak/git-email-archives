I don't think people really follow the links or think very abstractly at 
all in the first place.

So I was thinking more of some explicit examples. I actually think every 
command should have an example in the man-page, and hey, here's a patch to 
start things off.

Of course, I'm not exactly "Mr Documentation", and I don't know that this 
is the prettiest way to do this, but I checked that the resulting html and 
man-page seems at least reasonable.

And hey, if the examples look like each other, that's just because I'm 
also not "Mr Imagination".

I think most people understand a lot better from practice than from 
theory, and that an example of real usage is much more likely to make 
people udnerstand a command than just listing what it can do.
