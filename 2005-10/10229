Hmm. The "not ending in /" is a bad test. 

Especially in light of the fact that the git-pack protocol quite by design 
tends to add a ".git" to the end as a fallback, so that a user that wants 
to specify a particular directory _without_ that fallback needs to have 
the slash at the end.

Now, git-daemon hasn't implemented that, but I think that was just a 
mistake that grew out of it not getting a lot of testing, since it wasn't 
used much. I personally use the "without the final .git" version quite 
often, because it just looks so much nicer for the user.

In fact, here's a patch that makes git-daemon allow it, and thus match the 
behaviour of the ssh transport.

The logic is simple: if the original "chdir()" fails, try another one with 
".git" appended. This is in _addition_ to doing the 'chdir(".git")' later, 
so that if you have a checked-out git repository in /home/linux-2.6.git, 
then doing a

	git pull git://host/home/linux-2.6

will on the remote end do:

	chmod("/home/linux-2.6")	// fails with ENOENT
	chmod("/home/linux-2.6.git")	// works
	chmod(".git")			// works

resulting in it ending up in /home/linux-2.6.git/.git, which is exactly 
correct, and where it wants to be.

I personally find it a nice bit of usability enhancement. You can name 
your git repositories with a ".git" suffix (which can help all kinds of 
automated tasks - like autopacking), but you don't force your users to 
care.
