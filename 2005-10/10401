Almost. No, truly, I'm very impressed with git-merge.sh, which first 
does the simple git-read-tree -m, and it can then try several merger 
scripts to resolve the index. The "smartest" merge resolver we have 
follows renames, but we could have language-specific and 
project-specific resolvers, for instance.

If you combine the coolness of git-merge.sh with the fact that cg-merge 
right now is buggy[*]... I'm starting to rely on doing cg-fetch and 
running git-merge.sh by hand.

* I just merged your latest fixes, knowing that they'd conflict on 
cg-fetch, but the merge didn't say a thing a bout cg-fetch, and only 
complained like this:

    MERGE ERROR: : Not handling case  ->  ->

But there were no conflicts at all in the tree! It seems to be that it's 
dropping the upstream changes it doesn't like.

cheers,


martin
