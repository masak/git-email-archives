It's on Win2k, there was multiple cygwin installations in path, the other one
supposedly is 1.5.5 (it's from QNX Momentics installation).
I had that old "cygwin1.dll" renamed into "cygwin1.dll-disabled" long
ago, though...
I can't reproduce this out of GIT context, and the error is not
reproducable after
I removed the other cygwin installation out of PATH.
Anyway, sorry, I should have tried this before posting.
