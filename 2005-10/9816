This patch just moved an existing check from the process queue loop to the
appropriate places in transport-specific code to prevent the transport
from transferring an object that appeared in the local repository after
it was prefetched (eg. via a pack), and to make sure that all objects that
were prefetched are subsequently fetched so the transport can perform the
appropriate cleanup.
