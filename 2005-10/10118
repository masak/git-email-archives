The "master" branch has been updated with some "obviously
correct" updates, as usual.

In proposed updates, there are currently two topics.

One is the new tag dereference notation and showing the deref'ed
tag from the remote side via ls-remote I posted last night. 

I'd have this graduate to the "master" branch after some more
testing, only if people are interested in it; otherwise I'm
thinking about dropping this (I am not particularly interested
in this enhancement myself).

Another is the improved handling of funny characters in
pathnames.  The final notation follows what Paul Eggert outlined
in his message a couple of days ago -- C-style quoted string
enclosed in a pair of double-quotes.  I have not written formal
set of tests, but updated git-diff-*, git-ls-files, git-ls-tree,
and git-apply seem to do the right thing with my limited
hand-tests.
