Hmph.  If you really want something like that, I think you could
add a hook support for git-fetch to implement this as
automatically created lightweight tags, stashed in
$GIT_DIR/fetch-history/, deriving their names from the time of
the fetch; clone would grab everything below refs/ but this is
deliberately placed outside that hierarchy and won't get copied.
By definition, these point at commits reachable from some of
your heads (unless the remote repository maintainer is stupid
enough to rewind public trees ;-), so fsck-object would not see
them but it should not be a problem.
