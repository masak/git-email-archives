I noticed that rename(2) in my copy of cygwin (1.5.18-1) does not remove the
target and returns an error (probably EPERM, but I have reasons not to trust
strerror on that thing).
The repository was on FAT.
Taking "rename(2)" from cygwin's libiberty solved this (they unlink if link(2)
returns EEXIST).

PS: Does broken rename(2) qualify a system "not worthy to support"?
