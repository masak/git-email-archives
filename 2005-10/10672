Re-reading this, I seem to have misinterpreted the text. EPERM is
returned when the filesystem doesn't allow hard linking a directory.
I guess the closest error would actually be EMLINK, assuming that a
filesystem that doesn't support hardlinks would have LINK_MAX set to 1.

    Linux returns EPERM
    Coda returns EXDEV
    BSDs seem to return EOPNOTSUPP.
    MacOS X/Darwin doesn't mention it in their manpages.

Simply falling back on rename when there is any error, as Linus
suggested, seems like a pretty good solution right now. Rename should
give the same set of errors except when the link target already existed.
