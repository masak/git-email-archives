Here is mine.

I do not personally think it is too much of a restriction if we
said we only allow tags using letters from [-a-zA-Z0-9.] (yes I
am trying to be controversial by not allowing even latin-1
names).  Even without going that far, if we just said we do not
allow shell metacharacters in tagnames (i.e. assuming UTF-8
encoded pathnames, non-ascii part of unicode character space is
allowed), I suspect things will get much simpler to handle.

The troublesome tags Martin's repository had were autocreated
with cvsimport.  That is something we could easily fix (I think
we already do certain tagname munging).
