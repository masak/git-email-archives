At some point, we might want to have a series of refs tracking changes to 
the user's heads over time. Then the right set of arguments could actually 
handle "what would I have seen on Thursday, when I hadn't pulled since 
Tuesday, and upstream got some changes on Wednesday that I got on Friday, 
and it's Saturday now." (That is, Wednesday's commits hadn't hit the local 
repository yet; the commit that we got to is dated Friday for local 
purposes, and the latest as of Thursday is dated Tuesday, which is the 
last time the ref file was modified.)

And we probably don't want to fetch or clone this stuff; I doubt most 
people want to know the history from somebody else's point of view. At 
least, I can't think of a use for it that wouldn't be better served by 
asking whoever for the hash out of their history.
