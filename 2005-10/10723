Add the "-r" flag to do the recursive thing, ie

	git-diff-tree -r --name-only

should do the right thing.

Creating them is fast enough if there is no IO. Make sure your project is 
packed, and you should be ok.

The expensive part is the "-p" thing to create patches. If you avoid the 
patch creation, you should be ok.

I kind of like it, but I'm not sure how useful it is, and maybe it does 
really want the whole patch size (not just how many files it touches). 
That's where caching might save your *ss.
