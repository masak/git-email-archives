I actually mean UNIX (a.k.a. PF_LOCAL) sockets; git-ssh-fetch is connected 
to ssh via sockets from "socketpair()". Looks like you can set the buffer 
size with a socket option here, too, but I doubt ssh will try setting 
socket options on standard in and out, and git-ssh-fetch leaves them at 
their defaults. I'm not clear where the defaults for these come from in 
general.
