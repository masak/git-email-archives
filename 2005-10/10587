I can add a function in stgit/main.py which would list the options.
The tla-completion generates a file listing a command with its option
on every line:

  push -a -all -n --number -t --to --reverse --undo -h --help
  ...

Since I don't know much about the bash completion, let me know of the
format you'd prefer.

In general, it is better to use the stg commands but the repository
structure won't probably change for a long time and it's OK to
optimise (if the speed improvement is visible). Anyway, these
particular commands are pretty fast (they behave like cat) but there
are others which are slower (usually the commands involving calls to
the GIT tool).
