Hmm.. git can certainly handle slashes in tags, but you'd need to 
basically "mkdir" the path up to there before creating them. 

That's probably not the right thing to do for a tag that comes from the 
outside, since in git, the slashes work like in a filesystem, and should 
imply grouping (ie you might have a family of tags that is named by 
usage, and be called something like "release/xyz" or whatever).

Is "_" the right thing to replace it with, though? To me, "_" replaces 
either a space or a dash, while a slash could be replaced by something 
more like a special character.

Maybe it's just me, but your example "dev-stubs-merge-8-1-3/9/99" might
look nicer either of these ways:

 - dev-stubs-merge-8-1-3|9|99 (but "|" is hard to use with shell)
 - dev-stubs-merge-8-1-3.9.99 (CVS tags can't contain '.', right?)
 - dev-stubs-merge-8-1-3:9:99 (confuse with time?)
 - dev-stubs-merge-8-1-3+9+99 (one arithmetic op replaced by another)
 - dev-stubs-merge-8-1-3#9#99 (that's pretty ugly)
 - dev-stubs-merge-8-1-3?9?99 (Wayne might be right after all)
 - dev-stubs-merge-8-1-3_9_99 (maybe Wayne _is_ right?)

I dunno. But maybe we do want the option of just keeping it as a slash, 
and teach git-cvsimport to create the proper subdirectory prefixes.

I have no idea how to do that in perl, though. Right now it just does

	open(C,">$git_dir/refs/tags/$xtag")

how would you do "create file with all path components"?
