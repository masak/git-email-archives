Yes, "cg-reset --adds-removals" is what I want (how do I do this with
pure git?).

I would like to clear/reset the index because I've screwed it all up. 
I don't think I can do as you suggested because of the way I got into
this mess.

I'm using git/cogito to version control my hard drive and I've been
gradually adding more entries into the .gitignore file because some
files change too frequently or I don't want them backed up.  The OS
modified a bunch of files, I cg-rm'd 1/4 of them, then I changed my
mind and added them back, also did some genuine cg-adds, etc. and now
I'm all confused (it's a whole hard drive).  If other people are
interested in doing this I can pass on the lessons I learned.

What I found it git is amazingly fast!  cg-status only takes a few
seconds.  I think there are some problems if you try to do:

cd /
cg-add -r usr
cg-commit -m "take a long break"

It seems that cg-add-ing and cg-commit-ing smaller chunks is faster
than one big chunk.

I think commands for the following should be added to cogito:

cg-status -<status_flag>  # list files with given status flag (without
status flag in column 1)
  git-ls-files [--others|--deleted|etc] --exclude-per-directory=/.gitignore

cg-add [-r] -<status_flag> # add files with a given status flag
  git-ls-files [--others|--deleted|etc]
--exclude-per-directory=/.gitignore | while read i; do cg-add "$i;
done

cg-rm [-r] -<status_flag> # you get the idea.

cg-addremove  # recursively add new files, remove deleted files

I use "while read i" so it will work with spaces in filenames.
