A base less merge is a merge of two branches which do not have a
common ancestor. That is, git-merge-base --all branch-A branch-B will
not return any results.

A base less merge is handled exactly as if there was a common ancestor
for the two branches with an empty tree. Renames are detected by
executing git-diff-tree -M --diff-filter=R -r <common ancestor>
<branch-A> and the analogous command for <branch-B>. Hence, if <common
ancestor> corresponds to an empty tree no renames will be detected.

I guess the major difference between cherrypicking with
git-format-patch and merging is that a merge is pretty much an all or
nothing thing. If you merge a branch you will get every commit from
that branch (and if you don't merge you will obviously not get any
commits at all).

It's unfortunate that binary files aren't supported. I have been
thinking about doing something about it, there isn't any code yet
though.

Anyway, the idea I have thought about is to use (probably
base64-encoded) xdelta diffs for the binary files. With this approach
git diffs could look like:

diff --git --xdelta a/foo b/foo
<base64-encoded xdelta data>

Is this approach reasonable?
