Subject: Cogito: Merge failure when new remote has been added locally

I've set up an example project to play around with cogito/git. To simulate
patches flowing back and forth I set up several repositories, which I edit
independently. In this I run into trouble with a reasonable scenario:

 A creates a project, and publishes it

 B gets A's version, updates his version, and ships a patch (which creates
   stack.h) to A

 A merges in B's changes, and fixes a typo in stack.h

 B tries to update from A via cg-update, the merge fails because there is a
   local stack.h (which is different than the remote one). The resulting
   message is less than helpful.

A script showing the problem follows:

   mkdir tst1
   cd tst1
   echo "Initial" | cg-init
   
   cd ..
   cg-clone tst1 tst2

   cd tst2
   echo 'Hello!' > greet
   cg-add greet
   cg-commit -m "Add greet"

   cd ../tst1
   echo 'Hi there!' > greet
   cg-add greet
   cg-commit -m "Add greet"

   cd ../tst2
   cg-update

This gives:


     MERGE ERROR: : Not handling case  ->  ->

            Conflicts during merge. Do cg-commit after resolving them.

And there is nothing marked to fix by hand. cg-diff returns an empty
difference in greet.
