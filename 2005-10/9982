Dear diary, on Tue, Oct 11, 2005 at 04:45:49AM CEST, I got a letter
where Martin Langhoff <martin@catalyst.net.nz> told me that...

Hmm. Well, the '-d' option is silly and that's really what should read
as '-m', to keep it the same as cg-commit. Actually, I'd like to have it
as similar as possible, so it would be ideal to have cg-tag do something
like

	if got_argument '-e'; then
		if tty -s; then
			throw_together_some_CG:_stuff
			$EDITOR
			parse_the_CG:_stuff
		else
			cat >>logmsg
		fi
	fi

to keep it symmetric to cg-commit (except that it won't require the
message if you don't bother to pass it anything). Well, I guess the CG:
stuff parsing is lower priority (and would require some factoring out of
the common code from cg-commit), so I'll do the simple part soon
(today or on Thursday) if noone does it first. *hint* *hint* ;-)
