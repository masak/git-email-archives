So, this sounds like a classic resource scheduling problem
with various solutions encoded in many compiler schedulers.

Doesn't this sort of scheduling problem get solved by a
two-stage request pipeline model?  In particular, you only
"semi-request A" and "semi-request B" into a queue.  When
all of the sub-parts (that are needed) of some pack P have
been requested you issue the one request for the common
pack P holding all the sub-parts.  Then all the sub-parts
are can be retired from the queue.

Or am I just now finally catching up? :-)

Thanks,
jdl
