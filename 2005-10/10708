Right. Don't confuse $(..) with $((..)).

They have absolutely nothing to do with each other, except for looking a 
bit similar. 

The $((..)) is shell-builtin arithmetic. I could imagine a broken shell 
forking and executing "dc" for it, but quite frankly, that sounds so 
unlikely as to be totally silly. So realistically, a shell either supports 
it or not. 

Oh - there's another similarity between $(..) and $((..)). They're both 
POSIX 1003.2 standard features, so any "modern" shell should support them. 
Although in practice I don't know if that means anything else than ksh 
(where both syntaxes came from, actually).
