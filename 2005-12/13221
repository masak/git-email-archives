Your approach is good -- that's exactly how I use them too. I normally
use git-format-patch to review what patches I have 'pending' to be
pushed upstream. It's great because it knows your last common commit,
and it uses git-cherry to spot commits that are identical on both
sides.

We should perhaps create git-cvsexport, followning git-format-patch's
usage of git-cherry, and calling git-cvsexportcommit with them.
There's been talk about doing it -- I'll probably do it as soon as I
need it for a project. Feel free to have a go at it  ;-)

Strange. The getopts line should look like:

     getopts('hpvc');

(al least it does on my repo) which means that it doesn't expect
parameter _values_. Have you got the same line in the script? Perhaps
your getopts is broken or strange?

Well... you have the right idea... and yes it's a bit of a mess.

That's exactly the issue. It's somewhat manual -- because you can't
really automate it 100%. CVS won't know what to do with a merge, so
every time you develop in paralell under git and then merge, you'll
have to fudge things somehow to trick cvs. There's an impedance
mismatch there.
