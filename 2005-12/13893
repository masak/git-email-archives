Yes, you're right. But after all, this section was meant to put a little 
pressure on you to agree to core.umask ;-)

Well, it is a reality here ;-)

It is the simplest way to achieve the goal (at least that I could think 
of). Thanks for the compliment!

You are very welcome to do so!

Of course, the use case is git itself. I host a private version with all 
the goodies I like so much, and which you unfortunately do not like as 
much.

It is a phantastic way to keep git up to date without having to login 
manually. It is also a phantastic way to break the setup spectacularly 
when something goes wrong.

Is it too strict?

:        #!/bin/sh
:        
:        # if the working directory contains modifications, do not allow 
:        # push

This checks if the ref being pushed is the current HEAD:

:        HEAD=$(git-symbolic-ref HEAD)
:        case "$1" in
:        $HEAD)

Only if it is, this check occurs

:                unset GIT_DIR
:                cd .. && test -z "$(git-diff-index --name-only HEAD)";;
:        esac

IMHO this does exactly the right thing: Fail only if the ref to push is 
the current HEAD *and* something is not committed.

Yes, I feared that much. Also note that in my dangerous setup, something 
could go awfully wrong because post-update is currently compiling git 
itself, while somebody else wants to use it.

So, more and more I think about it, I should not do it then. But for a few 
days, I am the only user!

Thanks,
