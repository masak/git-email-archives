Hi Pavel,

 thanks for crash report, I will investigate it.

I will investigate what Qt designer allows abot font resizing.

I know what you mean ;-)

To avoid range select dialog simply call qgit with some command line option (arguments are feeded
to git-rev-parse, so the same options of gitk are allowed), qgit shows the dialog only if called
with no arguments.

If you don't want to type options just call qgit and press enter as soon as range select appears, 
by default you will see commits from HEAD to latest tag.

If, instead, you want to see whole the history, press "Canc" to delete "to" field tag and then
press enter. That's the reason the focus is on "to" field by default ;-)

An option at startup to bybass range select could be an idea tough.

"Show All" is simply a shortcut for git-rev-parse --show-all option, to see all the branches
between selected commit range.

Tags selection is to define selected commit range

Peraphs it should be better call it "Show all branches" and add a new check "Show whole history"


Thanks for your feedback.

Marco
