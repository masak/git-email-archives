I believe this effort is already well under way.
Uh, I also thought we were going to place it in
some "contrib" directory too...?

Also, before I learned of that bash completion effort,
I was contemplating modifying the git.c command recognition
so that it effectively did this:

   cmd = ... whatever from command line
   if (exec(cmd)) works then
       happily clean up and exit
   else
       using the existing directory scan as a new function,
       determine if "cmd" is a proper prefix of some command,
       if it is unique then
           exec(unique-cmd-disambiguated)
       else
           complain that it is not unique
       fi
    fi

That way:
    "git mer" would fail
    "git merge" would run "git-merge"
    "git merge-" would fail
    "git merge-o" would fail,
    "git-merge-oc" would run "git-merge-octopus".

Any interest?  Overkill?  Bad idea?
