Dear diary, on Sat, Dec 17, 2005 at 10:41:49AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...

  I think the '...' is just distracting. It makes cut'n'paste more
difficult, and it's usually fairly obvious that this is start of a hash,
and that the hash might not be complete.

  I was actually thinking to by default trim all the hashes Cogito show
to 12 or 16 characters. Seven still seems dangerously low to me, though;
it would be nice if the number of characters to trim would be
configurable (unless I've missed that).
