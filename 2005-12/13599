Subject: [PATCH] Make git-send-pack exit with error when some refs couldn't be pushed out
Date:	Wed, 14 Dec 2005 01:45:40 +0100

In case some refs couldn't be pushed out due to an error (mostly the
not-a-proper-subset error), make git-send-pack exit with non-zero status
after the push is over (that is, it still tries to push out the rest
of the refs).

Cogito (0.17pre only, 0.16 is unaffected) needs to know that the push
failed so that it won't update its remote branch head pointer - otherwise
it gets out of sync, which can lead even to loss of commits on the local
side (this happenned to Jonas Fonseca - thanks for the report, BTW).
I sort of expected that git-send-pack would return an error in case
of a failure, so just applying this should magically fix Cogito.

I don't insist on this particular solution though - a fetch-pack-alike
approach where I get the list of changed refs on stdout is fine too
(currently I get something on stderr, but I'm reluctant to grab stderr
of GIT commands and try to heuristically mangle it).

At any rate, please consider this a major problem from Cogito perspective.
