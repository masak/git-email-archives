You shouldn't "pull" tags. You should just "fetch" them.

The error message comes from the fact that the pull is a "fetch + merge", 
and the merge logic tries to figure out what the common parent is with 
"git-show-branch". And the common parent finding is limited to 29 commits.

(Which is a very reasonable limit: the normal case is 2, and doing an 
octopus-merge with more than four or five parents is already insane. Much 
less 30 parents).

Well, it's a known shortcoming, but it really ends up being a sign of you 
doing the wrong thing and trying to merge all the tags together. The merge 
would almost certainly fail, btw, regardless of anything else.

Junio - I think we should make "git pull" refuse to merge more than one 
head. If somebody wants to do an octopus merge, they can use "git merge" 
instead. Hmm?
