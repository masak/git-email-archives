I've done this also.  Personally, I feel a little more in control with a
fetch, merge, tag type of flow.  Maybe its just me but I couldn't get
used to pull doing it all for me so I like to split the operation so
that I can easily run a diff-tree between the two if I want after
performing the fetch.

While we're on the subject.  It might be nice if merge behaved a little
more like pull (without the fetch of course).  At the moment, I've got
to give merge three arguments whereas pull is happy with just one of
them.

So, sometimes I would like to type this
% git merge <head>

much like one would type
% git pull . <head>

Rather than typing
% git merge "Message" HEAD <head>

But, this might not be an easy API change to make.  I suppose I could
just type 'git pull . <head>' and be satisfied but my thought process
tells be that I'm merging branches rather than pulling so I usually
don't think about it.  I'm really just typing my stream of thought at
this point so I'll wrap it up.

Thanks,
Carl
