Yes. I like the notion of doing

	git-ls-tree -r -d HEAD

to get a full list of directories for the project.

That brings up another issue. I typed

	git-ls-tree -r --name-only ..

and it obviously didn't work. That's kind of sad. I use that quite a lot 
for "git diff", for example, because quite often I want to see the files, 
but I don't care about anything else.

Maybe nobody else uses that "--name-only" thing.
