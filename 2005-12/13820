The repository seems just fine with this single exception - no branch 
contains a reference to the commit that forms the chain of commits that 
would otherwise be described as a branch. As I understand it, then, the 
only thing that is missing is an entry in .git/refs/heads.

Experimentally, I added that entry by determining the first commit in 
that chain and echoing that sha1 into .git/refs/heads/some_name and that 
works as expected.

I suspect that the root cause was a 'git branch -D' I issued a while 
back. My question is this: if deleting a branch in that manner caused me 
to enter this situation, is that a bug or no? The commits in question 
*are* referenced by various tags, but not by any branch that exists any 
more.  The echo command effectively re-created the branch and all seems 
well.
