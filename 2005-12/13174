Trusting that I *won't* be able to write into that repository, I
tried to run that and after getting an error ("cannot update
info/refs file", which I wanted to see) I seem to be getting the
same segfault.  GDB session reveals the binary is heavily
optimized or inlined, so it is hard to see what it is doing
though.

But there is one thing that is mysterious about your repository,
and by mirroring that peculiarity with the copy in my home
directory, I managed to reproduce the problem with my copy.  Why
does the objects/info/alternates in that repository point at
itself?  I suspect if you remove that file you will be OK.

update-server-info simply dying, instead of complaining about
it, is a bug nevertheless, and removal of the
unnecessary/possibly wrong alternate is only a workaround, but I
hope that would unblock you in the meantime..
