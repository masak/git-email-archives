Actually, that was stdin and stdout. If, for some reason, a hook looked at 
stdin, it could get surprising results. I don't think that it's actually a 
good idea to have output to stdout from hooks go to git-send-pack's 
stdout, since we may want to have git-send-pack report some sort of 
information of its own to stdout, which would then get confused with 
output from hooks. I think /dev/null, a log file, and stderr are the 
reasonable choices for what happens to output (and input pretty much has 
to be /dev/null).
