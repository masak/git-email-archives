I am starting to work an svn-based upstream. In order to make life
easy for me and for them I am trying to figure out a way for them to
be able to merge my (emailed) patches atomically and preserving my
comments.

Something like git-am for svn.

Ideally, it should keep the patch as free of corruption as possible,
as the results will be echoed back into my branches via git-svnimport
and later "cg-update upstream" and I want git-cherry to have a fair go
at matching them.

There doesn't seem to be much. SVN-based projects ask for unified
diffs mostly, and I can't find indication of patch trading that
includes commit messages.

Any hints?

cheers,


martin
