Well it's easy to do, but then, in Linus tree, a single day would not fit
on my screen :-) So 'squeezed' mode is helpful for me, at least,
 to get big picture at a glance - in git tree, for example, I can see
the 0.99.5 release branch to  begin and end on a single screen.

And the question is: the colours are assigned to what:
branches ? authors ? committers ? repositories ?

But in this view, you can have only the number-of-lines-on-the-screen
commits visible. And with graphics done in javascript, scrolling is
painfully slow, at least in mozilla. And I think that implementing
quick search in a diagram will provide much more information
than one can get by 'visual grep' :-). So I don't know, need to think
a bit more .

Yep, the boxes intentionally are not clickable, I think it makes navigation
easier, perhaps it could be made as a preference..

Yes I also think about it. Initially the boxes were semi-transparent so
you could track the highlihgt under the box, it looked very nice,
but that was too slow to be usable on my computer, and opera
does not have that 'opacity' thing..

If I find a way to do it without further complicating placement algorightm,
maybe..

Thanks! Btw, I took the diff viewer pretty much unmodified from gitweb.
