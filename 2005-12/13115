I should have said "nobody should need to type that, otherwise
fix your Porcelain".

You are right, at least for the initial commit (for subsequent
commits it happily commits an empty tree).

Now why anybody would want to it is a different matter.  Is it
because you would want to record that your project started from
scratch, as opposed to some import from an existing non
versioned (or versioned by another SCM) working tree?

That sounds like a simple Porcelain bug and I hope neither
Cogito or git wouldn't have that problem now.
