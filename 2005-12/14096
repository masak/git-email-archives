GIT 1.0.6 was silently pushed out.  Again, it has one notable
fix among minor test fixes.

 - Do not mark tags fetched via --tags flag as mergeable.

   This is to fix "git pull --tags"; it tried to merge all of
   the tags by mistake --- it should not merge any of them.

I have verified that the patch by Gerrit to fix merge-order test
is correct, but have not got around to apply it yet.

The master branch has the following enhancements in addition to
what is in 1.0.6.  I intend to have 1.1 release with them early
next year, when I come back from the new year break.

 - "git clone -o branchname" to specify name of the branch used
   to keep track of the upstream (Johannes).
 
 - "core.sharedrepository" and "git init-db --shared" to help
   group writable repositories (Johannes).

 - IPV6 literal address in git networking protocol (Hideaki).

 - "git pack-redundant" is more efficient (Lukas).

 - "git describe" and associated Makefile changes to give GIT
   releases a bit more descriptive names (Linus and me).

 - "git checkout <treeish> <path>..." and "git checkout -- <path>..."
   can be used to restore named paths even from a subdirectory.

 - git-receive-pack propagates hooks' refusal to update back to
   git-send-pack.

I'll be away from the network and will be back on the second
week of January.  I wish everybody a happy new year.
