Lucky thing. I expect you still had all the objects required for the 
tree to do this. If you had run 'git prune' on the repo they would have 
been lost for good though.

It's not a bug. You probably meant to do

	$ git branch -d

-D forces removal even if there are objects reachable only through that 
branch. The man-page says so, but in git'ish, which isn't always 
intuitive until you've grown familiar with the glossary.txt doc.
