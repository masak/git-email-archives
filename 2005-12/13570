Thank you both for the patch, but I'd be much more comfortable if at
least quotes (both ' and "), backslashes, ? and * would be prohibited in
the names as well. Any chance of also implementing this policy upstream?
Taken to the extreme, using such a names for tags might be perceived as
a possible security vulnerability wrt. the less shell-savy users. ;-)
