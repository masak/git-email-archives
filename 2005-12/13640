yes, but only by the last applied "on the top of the stack."
When I do a commit, there is only 1 patch applied so this works okay.
(then I push the next patch after the commit and repeat...)

I'm not stuck by this problem, since I created a new release
branch based before the funny merge and it seems to be
working properly.  I'm sorry I can't re-create the problem
again.  Next time something like this happens and I notice it
I'll be sure to keep the ingredients for the failure on hand.

thanks,
