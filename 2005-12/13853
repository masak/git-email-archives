Hello, Marco!

Here's some assorted notes about current qgit.

Thanks for making the range dialog optional, but now I don't see any way
to see the local changes unless I re-enable the dialog.  I think it
should be an action activated from the menu - "diff local files to this
revision".  Or maybe the "local" radio button in the diff pane.

Current qgit seems to have another crash, also annotation related.  Run
qgit on its own repository.  Select "Add range select dialog options",
then double click on src/commitimpl.cpp in the file list.  Sometimes it
works, sometimes it crashes like this:

ASSERT getFileAnnotation: no revision
9771bea705024b3d0a59e1b9144adf5d77ca82d1

Sometimes you need to select other revisions and double click on other
files.  Another assert I got was:

ASSERT getFileAnnotation: no revision
bbf2abcbcafc2e458343034c8f249ac4956ec4fb

"git-cat-file commit" works fine on both revisions.  Just in case, I'm
seeing this on x86_64.

"View->Revision Diff" and "View->Archive Tree" work differently.  The
former doesn't allow to turn the pane off.  I'd like it to work like
"View->Archive Tree".  Neither can "Revision Diff" be closed from the
popup menu.
