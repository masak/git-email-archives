What would shell.umask do? Be set only when git-shell is called? Then you 
better have the policy to access that particular repository *only* via 
git-shell. Voila, it is the same effect as of core.umask.

What would shared.umask do? Be set only when writing to GIT_DIR? This is a 
major task, since you have to find out which writes are to the working 
directory, which ones go to GIT_DIR.

And you have to workout a policy (as I just answered in this thread) how 
to deal with a checked out HEAD where you can't write to the working 
directory (or at least modify the checked out files).

The sanest way I can think of is either to disallow checkout, or to make 
the files writable to the group. Both methods do fine with core.umask.

Now that I think of it: A third possibility is to disallow pushing to the 
checked out HEAD. Is this desirable? I think not. The user who works in 
the working directory exclusively would have to keep track of the 
pushed ref herself, instead of the user who pushed the ref. Sounds silly 
to me.

Hth,
Dscho
