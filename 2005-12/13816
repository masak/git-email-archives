AFAIU, yes.

For future reference, what you should have done is this;

$ git format-patch --mbox <first-unscrewed-commit-ish>
# edit commit-messages in generated patches
$ git reset --hard <first-unscrewed-commit-ish>
$ for i in 00*.txt; do git apply < $i; done
$ git prune;# to get rid of the unreachable objects AFTER you've checked 
everything's all right

If things fail, do

$ git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD

and ask again.

I'm afraid I can't help you fix up your repository from the state it's 
in now. AFAIK, there's no tool to do it automagically.
