ORIG suggests "origin" to me, something that was there first, or before 
anything else.  If you want to undo something, you want its "previous" 
state restored relative to the current state, not the absolute previous 
(first) one.

Well, cogito for one doesn't care at all, and it even doesn't make for 
it to be created/updated.

But still it can remain for what it is now, and PREV_HEAD added for undo 
purpose.

Not a big deal in any case though.
