Note sure what your Debian dilemma is.  Right now, Debian (Unstable) seems 
broken, because cogito is still at 0.16.0 and hickups on the bash 3.1 issue 
discussed in an earlier thread.  Having updated to the debian version from my 
earlier self built version earlier this week, I immediately found I couldn't 
commit.

After waiting a day for the next release to filter through and it not doing 
so, I had to rebuild my own version again - and as far as I am aware, despite 
a new version of git-core arriving on my "update" this  morning, there has 
been no new cogito package.
