i was wondering why "stg push" takes so long to decide not to use
fast-forward.

it turns out that when forward_patches() has not been able to fast-
forward any patches, it still does a git.switch() and rewrites the
unapplied file even though nothing has changed.  on a big working
directory, this 'no-op' can take a while.

following is a simple patch that addresses the problem.  does this appear
to be a reasonable optimization (in terms of correctness)?
