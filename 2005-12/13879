Yup, that's why I tried both.

I do not doubt you got a failure.  I just couldn't reproduce it
easily by fetching into a copy of a stale repository.  Earlier I
was suspecting mirroring lags (my successful trial was done
within the last hour) but I do not think that is the case
because your failure was also way after the mirroring should
have happened.

Will dig a bit more when able.
