I'm getting

	...
	+ git merge 'Merge a, b, c' master a b c
	Trying simple merge with a
	Trying simple merge with b
	Trying simple merge with c
	Simple merge did not work, trying automatic merge.
	Removing c
	Merge 9ca217790c7e6581fe0b8b3b4baf026d03584c66, made by octopus.
	 a |    1 +
	 b |    1 +
	 c |    1 -
	 3 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
	 delete mode 100644 c

and I don't see why you wouldn't get that too.
