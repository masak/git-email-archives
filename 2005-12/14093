Having preformatted documentation is a great step forward, but it
would be even better if we could have it without installing some weird
RPM tool or a local copy of the Git repository -- not all my machines
have that.

Besides, it's not very beginner- or newcomer-friendly. Grab the
source; discover you need a complex toolchain to have manpages; maybe
learn sometime later that "all you had to do" was get an RPM and
explode some parts of it -- nah, it just doesn't feel right.

You're already generating five RPMs and two tarballs everytime you
release a version, would it be much more taxing to generate a third
tarball?

That said, those two new branches are neat. Thanks!
