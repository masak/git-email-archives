I'd like to require it to be a hash, just because that makes it 
prohibitively difficult to make something people will accept as
pack-05f611b3b8198b262acdf678584d365f8e879aec.pack other than the one from 
the git repository. Sure, it would only be a minor DoS and a bit of 
confusion, because it still couldn't do any worse than contain some 
different objects, but it would block people from getting the pack with 
the objects they want. Since nobody seems interested in naming their 
packs, so far as I know, it seems best to force the names to be 
universally unique, modulo an incredible coincidence.
