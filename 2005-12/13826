We do transfer multiple things already, and all protocol
exchange happens before everything is transferred.  And hooks
are run for each refs being updated, one by one.  What we do not
have is a reporting mechanism that says "we refused to update
this ref because of the hooks/update policy return value for
it".  Even if we later add that reporting mechanism, as I
outlined in a separate message earlier, I think it is OK to keep
running the update hooks after the pack transfer part.

This part I mostly agree with.  Will have to think about the
details but probably I'd punt this for now and declare it post
1.0 ;-).
