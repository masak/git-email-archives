I am glad somebody is paying attention.

The ref-to-object-name loop in get_sha1_basic() gets what the
user gave us, first checks it immediately under .git/ and then
under .git/refs, .git/refs/tags, .git/refs/heads, in this order.
Originally it grabbed the first match.  For the last couple of
weeks, it has been made "extra careful" to detect a case where
both .git/refs/heads/foo and .git/refs/tags/foo exists and
to reject unadorned "foo" with complaints.

I have been nagged by a suspition that the whole disambiguation
business should not be there [*1*].  I think the original
semantics of getting the first match is as easy to explain, if
not easier, as the current one, and I suspect that we do not
have to worry about .git/refs/heads/HEAD if we did so.  If
somebody is curious enough to name a branch "HEAD", the only
thing she should be aware of is this search order, and wherever
"branchname" is called for she should be able to say "HEAD" to
mean .git/refs/heads/HEAD, but places that call for an arbitrary
object name, she needs to disambiguate by saying "heads/HEAD" or
even "refs/heads/HEAD".

I suspect that git barebone Porcelain-ish carelessly uses
"git-rev-parse --verify $branchname" when it really means
"git-rev-parse --verify refs/heads/$branchname" in some places
[*2*], but if we fix them, we may not even need to have the "we
do not like HEAD" patch by Johannes (which has already been
merged).

Probably post 1.0 --- I have not assessed the extent of
confusion yet.


[Footnote]

*1* It was not in Linus version, and I consider anything I added
recently is of suspecious design value.

*2* That is, where we advertise that we get branchname as
parameter to the command.
