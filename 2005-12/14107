I checked and that bug has been fixed since the older version of git that
was causing me problems. "git non_existent_command" now returns 1.
However, the error message was also changed to
goto stderr, which it sounds like you disagree with?   Personally
I don't have a problem with it, although a real "git-help" command
might be a good idea too.
