Dear diary, on Wed, Dec 14, 2005 at 05:15:09PM CET, I got a letter

I mentioned the #git channel on the FreeNode network in several Cogito
announcements, but this problem report was actually in a different
channel (#elinks, since it occurred during work on ELinks) and it
wouldn't make a difference if it was on a query or in a private mail.

Sure, all important things are going on here, but it's often much more
convenient to do some troubleshooting and stuff over IRC, and way too
many people also mail me privately (sometimes it makes sense, sometimes
they would be better off cc'ing the list).

#git serves mainly as quick help wrt. GIT usage, sometimes people report
problems there (but for non-Cogito problems, I usually redir them to the
mailing list), and sometimes (but quite rarely) larger feature-wise
discussion spins out; but if it's about to get anything near real, it
usually hits the mailing list anyway. Oh, and CIA reports Cogito commits
on the channel.

The only IRC-only effort ever (so far) was I believe adding the
cg-switch command.
