In my case it was the freshly build directory where a chmod 0666 * was
done. This directory wont rebuild (the dates are correct), and the
tests run, as if nothing happened.
I actually noticed only after a half an hour, that I wasn't running
the executables I expected.

Yes, but they are not obvious. It is also not obvious what to do,
because everything seams alright.
