Yes, but I think the real question Bahadir wants to know is what
the <commit> parameter should be, if you want to export the
whole history (I do not think there is any suitable argument to
"format-patch" that does this).

Depends on what you have, to ask the question "what are their
object names?".

 - I have this commit, how do I find out its object name?
   E.g. I want to know the HEAD commit's object name, second to
   the last commit on "test" branch.

   $ git rev-parse --verify HEAD
   $ git rev-parse --verify test^

 - I have bunch of commits leading to the head of my "test"
   branch.  What are they?

   $ git rev-list test ;# unadorned list of object names and nothing else
   $ git rev-list --pretty test ;# this is git-log
   $ git whatchanged -m -M -p test ;# with patch in full glory
