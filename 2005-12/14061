This is a minor bugfix release.  There is one real fix by
Johannes that would help people who manage symlinks with git.

Starting from this one I won't be touching debian/ directory,
nor supplying pre-built Debian binaries anymore.
The official maintainer seems to be reasonably quick to package
up things.  The packaging procedure used there seems to be quite
different from what I have, so I'd like to avoid potential
confusion and reduce work by the official maintainer and myself.

Also I've enhanced the post-update hook of git.git repository to
automatically prepare preformatted documentation, which I'll
cover in a separate message.
