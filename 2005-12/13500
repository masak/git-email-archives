  Hello,

Dear diary, on Sun, Dec 11, 2005 at 09:31:07AM CET, I got a letter
where Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org> said that...
> it's now working again. Thanks. What do you think about another release?

  yes, I was planning 0.16.1 on Sunday anyway. Going to tag it now.

> There exists also another problem with the new bash. It is the broken

  Then that's quite funny, one-line broken pipe message has been always
there (in the past it looked much worse, we thankfully managed to bring
it down to this at least).
