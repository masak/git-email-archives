If I was a complete newbie, I would be lost right here.  You start refering to 
the term HEAD without any introduction to what it means and (as far as I 
could see on a quick glance - which is what a newbie would do - man git 
doesn't start out here either).

If your audience really is a complete new commer, then as a minimum I think 
you need  to describe to concept of a "branch of development" with a series 
of snapshots of the state, the current of which is called HEAD.  You might 
even at this stage hint about there being several such branches.  The next 
bit, which goes on about the index is great - just put it into context with a 
simple explanation first.
