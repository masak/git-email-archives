This is what happens when you have people too used to using the
pre-porcelain plumbing.

How about just
git-commit <the paths you hand corrected>

If you forget any, the commit will fail, but they will have been
updated in the index, and you don't need to mention them again in the
next attempt.


(Grump... I just noticed that the "recursive" merge stratgy *doesn't*
generate a merged file containing conflict markers, at least not in
the case I tried.  Instead I get "a~HEAD" and "a~branch" files.
Time to fix the docs...)
