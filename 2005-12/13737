I now have a git merge question.  I decided to try merging branches
and was left with a situation in which the file was moved on the
master branch and updated on my branch.  Not sure how to properly
integrate the changes from my branch.

For example:
%git checkout -b test v2.6.14
%<manually apply all the 2.6.14.z stable patches>
%<commit those patches>
%git checkout -b test2 v2.6.15-rc4
%git pull . test

Now over the course of 2.6.15 the arch/ppc64 was renamed to
arch/powerpc.  Fine. The merge algorithms handled all the unchanged
files properly.  However arch/ppc64/Kconfig was modified and the
merging was left unresolved.  In fact there is no file no merge
against (because it moved).  So 'git-ls-files -u' only shows stage 1+3
(no stage 2, of course).

How do I merge those changes?  I don't know enough about all the git
commands to figure this out, especially how to take advantage of the
stage 1, 2, and 3 files.

Thanks for any help,
Don
