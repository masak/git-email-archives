Dear diary, on Fri, Dec 09, 2005 at 01:47:56AM CET, I got a letter

I think that the first paragraph of the background material means
"insert Documentation/git.txt here", the second one is then "now what
might've been unclear there".

That said, the "git for the confused" contains a lot of nice points, but
I don't think it's a good approach to just have extra document for
clarifying this stuff. It would be much better if the stock
documentation itself would not be confusing in the first place. Same
goes for the "commands overview" (BOUND to get out-of-date over time
since it's detached from the normal per-command documentation; we have
troubles huge enough to keep usage strings in sync, let alone the
manpages).
