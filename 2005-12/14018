AFAIK all of the Win32 APIs accept either forward or backward slash as a
separator.  It has been this way since when they added directories to DOS.

What doesn't always accept forward slashes are commandline utilities that
are using '/' as an option separator.  Most of them these days will accept
the '/', at least in many circumstances.
