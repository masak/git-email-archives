Actually I think I do understand the question.  You have a clone
of linux-2.6 repository, and your "origin" branch tracks the
bleeding edge from Linus.  You also have "myhack" branch that
was forked off from 2.6.14, and wanted to see what new things
Linus has by updating "origin", and perhaps merge those changes
into your "master" which keeps track of your hacks based on
Linus tip, but unfortunately you were on "myhack" branch.

Ouch.

So what you wanted to do was probably:

	$ git fetch ;# this updates "origin" to Linus tip

instead of

	$ git pull ;# this updates "origin" to Linus tip *and*
                    # merges that into the current branch

As you may probably know, you can recover by

	$ git reset --hard

While I am sympathetic, this "Oops, I said pull when I meant
fetch" sounds remotely similar to "oops, I said 'rm -r' when I
meant to say 'ls -r'".  Is it that the tool is too fragile?
