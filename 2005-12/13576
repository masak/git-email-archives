Thanks for the report.

Once I considered changing commit-tree to take any committish
after -p, but thought the command is a low level primitive and
the user should know what he is doing, but apparently, git-merge
does not know what it is doing ;-).

In fact, I never use "merge" myself, and haven't noticed this
breakage until now (you would notice that the Everyday document
never talks about "git merge").  Instead, I always do this:

	$ git pull . tag release-0.3.1

But you are right.  It is advertised as the end-user
command and demonstrated in the tutorial.

How about this patch?  I haven't looked at what (old)
git-resolve and git-octopus commands do --- they may need
similar parameter massaging.

[PATCH] allow merging any committish

Although "git-merge" is advertised as the end-user level command
(instead of being a "git-pull" backend), it was not prepared to
take tag objects that point at commits and barfed when fed one.
Sanitize the input while we validate them, for which we already
have a loop.
