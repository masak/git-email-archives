Subject: [PATCH] Update the git-ls-tree documentation

This patch aims to freshen up a bit the git-ls-tree documentation. It hints
that the list of paths are in fact patterns to be matched, explains the new
-t, --name-only and --name-status options, corrects the original autorship
information to refer to yours sincerely, corrects several grammar mistakes,
etc.

Since the documentation still deserves some significant work (at least
proper description of the pattern matching), I also added the stub notice.

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
-Lists the contents of a tree object, like what "/bin/ls -a" does
-in the current working directory.
+Lists the contents of a given tree object, like what "/bin/ls -a" does
+in the current working directory. Note that the usage is subtly different,
+though - 'paths' denote just a list of patterns to match, e.g. so specifying
+directory name (without '-r') will behave differently, and order of the
+arguments does not matter.
