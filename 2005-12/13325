I thought I was seeing the full path of the repository as GIT_DIR and I 
didn't check the cwd.

I didn't see it in the place "grep post-update Documentation/*" returned, 
so we need something. (Actually, the main thing is to specify that nothing 
else special is set, because the GIT_DIR thing was pretty obvious, but I 
then didn't know if my problems were due to something else undocumented.)

I'll send a patch tonight which works for me, but it should probably be 
checked over by people who are good at this sort of stuff. I've got a 
"/dev/null" patch; I'll look into a version that tries to find a 
controlling tty (which could be really interesting, since you could then 
have the hook get input from the user), or at least copy stderr if 
possible.

For reference, the error I was getting was a broken pipe writing to stdout 
(as git merge does somewhere) when I've pushed locally.
