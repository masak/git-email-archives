I'd almost suggest skipping the technical notes in the current tutorial, 
and just gearing it directly more towards a regular user. 

When I started writing it, I cared more about people understanding how git 
works internally. I think that was useful too, but I suspect that it's 
less useful than just knowing how to use git, and there _are_ enough 
people out there that understand how git works under the hood that it 
probably would be much better to concentrate on getting people _first_ 
used to using git, and then having a separate tutorial for "what goes 
under the hood".

So instead of teaching people about "git-read-tree --reset HEAD" etc that 
you'd never know on your own, just teach about "git reset". And not 
bothering with the "git-write-tree + git-commit-tree + git-update-ref" 
approach, just make people use "git commit" from the very beginning.

Anybody willing to just strip out the raw internals talk?

Then we could add a small section about importing from a tar-file.
