Would this file perhaps also have examples?

I really think a lot of people learn better from examples than from having 
pointers to git programs that can be useful.

For example, earlier today I got the bash tar-ball because I had forgotten 
what the magic config option was to make bash do the right thing wrt pipe 
write errors. And because I'm totally dependent on "git grep" these days, 
I turned that tar-ball into a git archive. It's really a sinfully simple 
thing to do, but I don't think we mention that anywhere in the docs.

Here's what I did:

	# Extract the thing as normal
	zcat < bash-3.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	cd bash-3.0/

	# make a git archive out of it
	git init-db
	git add .
	git commit

and that's it. That creates a git archive from a tar-ball. Very simple, 
and short sequences like these would make tons of sense for a "cheat 
sheet" like yours, and I really think most people can look at those three 
git commands and suddenly they understand what they do a lot better than 
by reading the man-pages.

Or maybe it's just me. But I know _I_ understand things better by seeing 
the "context" that they are used in. Then I go to man-pages later on, if I 
want to know the details.

No?
