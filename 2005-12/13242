Same thing for 5.9.

With the "compat update" patch from last night, I managed to
build on a borrowed sparc with Solaris 5.9, but I needed
NO_SETENV myself.  I'd like to throw in another Makefile patch
to catch both 5.8 and 5.9 for this, but would appreciate if
people with various vintage of Solaris boxes can give some
inputs before doing that.

This was done with somewhat stripped down configuration.  I had
to say NO_EXPAT, libiconv was needed but iconv and openssl were
installed at nonstandard places, python was 2.3 so I also said
PYTHON_PATH and WITH_OWN_SUBPROCESS_PY from the make command
line.  But the borrowed box is not what I administer myself, so
I declare victory for now.
