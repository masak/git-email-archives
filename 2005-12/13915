I definitely don't get that here. Bleugh!

One thing that seemed kinda neat that I saw somewhere (perhaps in  
darcs?) is that it will tab complete only commands that would make  
sense in the present location (so cg <tab> would perhaps only bring  
up 'init' and 'help' in a non-git directory) - that would be rather  
more invasive to implement, I expect.

Another thing that has been mooted is autogenerating the completion  
code based on USAGE info - I've had a hack about in the past with  
that (its in the autogen branch in the gitcompletion repo on  
hawaga.org.uk) but then I reached the point where it seemed too icky  
for my tastes...
