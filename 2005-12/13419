I have a lot of interest in writing an XS interface for GIT but I've been waiting for 1.0
to officially release so I can be assured of a somewhat stable interface target.

I started working on a GIT-XS project around GIT 0.9 timeframe, but the changes to APIs
and calls was still way too rapid, so I decided to back burner it. 

I haven't looked at the libification work that Smurf is doing (haven't made time for it
lately), but if it's not TOO python specific, maybe I can use it too.

Cheers,
