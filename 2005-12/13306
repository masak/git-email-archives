Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

Perhaps printf '%s' "$blah" to futureproof, instead of just
saying printf "$blah"?

<rant mode on>
While I do not have anything aginst system without "sane" echo,
I really do not like it.  Not your solution, but *having to do*
something like that.

metaconfig Configure does "echo $n frotz $c" with n=-n or c=\\c
set appropriately; autoconf does the same with $ac_n $ac_c.
IIRC, I think ancient autoconf did "echo | tr -d '\012'".  

These are far worse than a single printf, although they may be
more portable.

As a traditionalist, if I were doing it myself I would probably
pipe echo to tr, but I am lazy so I'd take your patch as is ;-).
