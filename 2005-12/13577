There is a small improvement I would like to see it 'git commit'.
I am using 0.99.9i at this moment.

If I perform a 'git commit' on a series of files, and then decide not to 
perform the commit, I can back out of the operation with a blank commit 
message. Additionally, it would be nice for git commit to recognize a 
non-zero exit code theoretically indicating 'aborted commit'. In any 
case, the problem is that, even though git /states/ that it has aborted 
the commit due to the empty commit message, git diff /appears/ to show 
that the commit took place. a 'git reset' takes care of things for me 
but it was rather confusing at first and it seems counter-intuitive. I'm 
hoping that the behavior here can be changed before 1.0 is released, 
which I am in eager anticipation for.  Thanks!
