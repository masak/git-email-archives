No special reason besides that the owner is generated automatically from
the file permissions on the master server along with searching for
repositories and creating the list. We currently have more than one
"Linus' kernel tree" descriptions, so if we would rely on in-repo data
for the owner, the owner would be wrong on that repos too.
