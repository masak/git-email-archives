Cloning from scratch probably worked differently than starting
from wherever I was.

Sorry, I didn't preserve the exact state from where I started... I
think my last update was yesterday afternoon.  Would have been a good
test case.  However, I'm very clear on the symptoms... trying to start
from wherever I had last updated, to update to the current release,
failed when sucking from HTTP, but worked when sucking from GIT.

In fact, I got the same exact behavior both on my Darwin laptop and my
OpenBSD box, so I had to edit them both to get away from HTTP
protocol.
