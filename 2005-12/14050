No, I did not test them. At least not consciously (I did the whole work on 
Dec 24, when I was lying in bed, ill, trying to distract myself from being 
miserable).

The reason I did it this way: If zlib inflates a buffer of 0 bytes, it 
makes no sense to expect anything than 0 bytes to come out of it, right? 
Therefore, if zlib encounters a deflated buffer of 0 bytes, it should 
inflate it to 0 bytes. So it is a good idea in any case to write out 0 
bytes.

However, thinking of it again, it might break backwards compatibility. But 
I don't think so.

To be honest: I did not completely understand what that code does. 
It seemed obvious, but I got a track record of breaking things. So I was 
cautious. I will not try to modify it myself without a good test case.

If nr_objects == 0, we could write out a fixed index.

We could alternatively exit(1), because what sense does it make to have an 
index if the pack contains 0 objects? However, this has consequences: 
Every user of index-pack (does "fetch-pack --keep" call it?) has to be 
aware that empty packs are illegal.

Again, I did this so that the tool does not break. I'll try to come up 
with something better soon.

Right.

I was cautious. Maybe at some point in future, zlib relies on that. But it 
is probably better to try not calling zlib at all in these cases.

Sounds easiest.
