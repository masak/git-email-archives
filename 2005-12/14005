The worst trouble you're likely to run into is all the hardcoded paths. 
They are everywhere and ofcourse use the / for path entity separation.

The fact that there are 39 bash'ish shell-scripts does little to help a 
native port, and although they can be fairly easily replaced by "real" 
programs it still means quite a bit of work with little real value for 
the unix-version, so I'm guessing you'll have to write those up for 
yourself.

Is there some reason you can't install Cygwin, which effectively 
overcomes both those problems?
