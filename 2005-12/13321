OK, I see my mistake.

I should have tested better. I started off with a non-versioned directory
containing dotfiles and regular files. I did a cg-init, only to discover
that the dotfiles were not included in the repository at that time. So I
just assumed they couldn't be added either.

But I just tested, and yes indeed, it is possible to cg-add a dotfile.

So my question is, why does cg-init ignore dotfiles within the directory when it
first initializes the repository?

Be well,
Zack
