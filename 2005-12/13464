Good.

This should not be an error. The user was asking for the usage message.

Good unless the message was printed due to -h or --help, then it should 
go to stdout.

Not using $0 can make it _extremely_ annoying to determine exactly which 
program printed the usage message. It may look prettier without the path 
but if I have more that one $(basename $0) it may not be trivial to 
determine the one that issued the message. Also keep in mind that is it 
possible to have spaces in names of executables. So, "foo-bar" and "foo 
bar" may be two different executables.
