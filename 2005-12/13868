Indeed.  Thank you!

It shouldn't be an option.  It should be an action, available on demand,
regardless of options.  In the majority of cases, only diff to the head
revision is needed, but some users may want to see diff against other
revisions, e.g. when verifying manual merge.

Maybe there should be an option to check the local diff on startup and
indicate it somehow (not necessarily in the revision list) if it's not
empty.

But I'm not a GUI expert and I don't know how to make it easy to
discover without being constantly in the way.
