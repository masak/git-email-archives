I suspect a bash started from ssh noninteractive session does
not read .bash_profile --- you may want to check.

Not yet ;-)

Arrrgh....what a hack.  But it is a good hack.

I am very tempted to end this sentence with "please don't" ;-).

Your update hook looks sane if too strict.  I do not think of
any reason to push and fast forward a branch that is not pointed
at by .git/HEAD.  Not that I encourage pushing into a non-naked
repository where an uncontrolled random development happens,
though.

Although it does protect against stomping on each other by
read/do-work/re-read-and-swap cycle, push does not lock. If you
want to run a build from the post-update hook you need to
serialize the build yourself.
