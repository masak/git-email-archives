It's not much better for efficiency, but it's a whole lot easier to write 
the script without having to worry about a temporary file, what could 
happen to it while you're trying to use it, and making sure it gets 
cleaned up afterwards. It can also save on disk writes, depending on where 
you put it and how the system is configured.
