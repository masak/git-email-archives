  Hello,

Dear diary, on Sat, Dec 10, 2005 at 02:18:44PM CET, I got a letter
where Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org> said that...
> The cogito is the latest from kernel.org and when calling cg-commit it

  it seems like the newer bash is stricter than the older versions in
some obscure regards. Quoting the eval arguments (which is the proper
thing to do anyway) fixed that particular problem; I've hit another
problem during a test commit wrt. whitespace separators - I've fixed
that too, and pushed out.

  Thanks,
