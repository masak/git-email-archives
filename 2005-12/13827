If we have the reporting mechanism, that will effectively be part of the 
protocol. It's obviously done transferring the pack at that point, but it 
still wants fixed-format communication, so switching over to being the 
stardard output of the hooks would cause problems with this.

It's probably worth making sure that all the hooks run with something 
sane, and punt making it configurable andnice until post-1.0. I was only 
really looking at post-update, so I don't know how the others run.
