I agree this change to send-pack is a good fix (I haven't looked
at the code, but the above description describes a good fix).

However, I am not quite sure if the recent change to Cogito to
update the mirror of remote branch is a good one.  Since I am
not a Cogito user, I did not question it when I saw the change,
but I wondered what you are using the cached "remote ref is
supposed to be pointing at this commit" knowledge for.  If it is
only "pretending to have fetched the remote branch immediately
after we pushed into it before anybody else touched the same
remote branch", then it probably is benign.  But this bit
puzzles and worries me:

I do not remember seeing that report so I do not know how that
lossage happens with unreleased Cogito, but I suspect there is
something very fishy going on here.  I presume it happens when
the next fetch/pull from the remote is run, but if the locally
cached information can affect the next fetch/pull in such a way,
wouldn't updates by other people to the shared remote repository
branch also cause things to go out-of-sync and cause the same
breakage?
