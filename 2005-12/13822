If we extend it to transfer multiple things, wouldn't we want to run hooks 
after each of them, rather than all at the end?

As for the policy:

We definitely want to let hooks write to stdout, because git programs that 
you might want to run in hooks write to stdout. I can't figure out what 
"cvs" does with trigger script output and "at" and "cron" email the output 
to the owners. I'd sort of like to avoid making people expect that there 
is necessarily a path for text going back to the user directly. We may, 
for example, want to support these hooks with pushes over HTTP(/WebDAV). I 
also think that messages are likely to be at least as useful to the owner 
of the target repository as the person pushing, which is why I'd prefer a 
log file. E.g., if you've got a group central repository that different 
people push to, it may be other group members who want to know what 
happened with the output from a post-update hook, not the group member who 
pushed.
