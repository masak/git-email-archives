The vger.kernel.org spam filter filters out all non-ascii character
sets.  We have to do this because Matti and myself do all of the
filtering by hand, and we do not understand so many languages as to be
able to make sensible filters for spam in languages such as Japanese,
Korean, Chinese, Russian, etc. so we just filter them all.

I've asked people, such as Yoshifuji-san, on a number of occaisions if
they would mind not including Japanese characters (even if it is their
name in their FROM: field) in postings to the lists.

As long as they continue to do so, replies to their postings will be
filterd when their From: field ends up in the body of the posting.  I
edit the Japanese characters out by hand when I make replies to such
postings, and that is why my responses show up.

This is a pain, but no better solutions have been suggested.  Before
anyone responds: 1) making the lists subscriber-only is not an option
2) Bayesian filters are hard to integrate into our setup but we are
exploring ways to make that a reality at some point nevertheless.
