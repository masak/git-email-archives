I know it's pointless, but continuing the rant...

> On AIX, there is no -n option to the system's echo.

What the F***?  "echo -n" was added in 7th edition:
http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V7/usr/src/cmd/echo.c.html
(It's not in 6th edition:
http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V6/usr/source/s1/echo.c.html)

Now, I realize that AIX is derived from UCLA Locus, which branched
off from the Bell Labs source before 7th ed., but you'd think in the
intervening twenty-seven years someone would have had slightly more brains
than a pithed frog and have thought to add the 7th edition features?
