Should I be using something different than git merge?
is Documentation/howto/using-topic-branches out of date?

$ git merge-base -a 0a47c906342e2447003e207d23917dfa5c912071 =
d2149b542382bfc206cb28485108f6470c979566

Doesn't appear to be the case, as I don't have a /usr/bin/git
IIR, months ago I tried to install the rpm and
it failed due to some incompatibility like not groking
a SuSE destination.  I got Dave's git tarball according
to Jeff's howto: http://linux.yyz.us/git-howto.html
and have been building and installing from a git repo since.
(I found git-current tarball dated 7/21/05, so maybe it was then)
I did, however a few months ago copy my i386 home directory over to the
x86_64 box I use now, re-build and re-install.  Dunno
if there may have been a hickup in that process...
I found a backup copy of my i386 bin directory from 2005-08-25 --
binaries still in i386 format.  But I don't think I ran that b/c
it isn't on any PATH.  Git lives in ~/bin which is 1st in my PATH.

I think the lesson I'm taking away from this is that
as I continue to stumble forward using git I should
immediately report anything that doesn't look quite right
while I can still guarantee that all the clues are still
at the scene of the crime.  I expect that I've re-built
and re-installed git several times since the merge
in question was made.
