Per Tony's topic-branches howto, I do plenty of branching,
where the topic branch name , #### below , is a 4-digit number:

git checkout -b #### linus

and I use the wrapper script to do this:

git checkout test && git merge "Pull #### into test branch" test ####
git checkout release && git merge "Pull #### into release branch" release ####


But
1. I don't create tags with #### names, indeed, I never use tags at all
2. I agree that while #### names may be an area of a potential
   problem, it may not be related to the observed failure.  This is
   because the file in question was added to to a topic branch called "acpica"
   which IIR never interacted in any way with a branched named ####,
   but only with the branches called "linus" and "test".

I too suspect that a failed automatic merge is related.
Likely the sequence of events is not something that either
a git expert or a git beginner would ever issue, but takes
somebody like me who knows just enough to be dangerous:-)
