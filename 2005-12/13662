Dear diary, on Thu, Dec 15, 2005 at 12:44:43AM CET, I got a letter
where "H. Peter Anvin" <hpa@zytor.com> said that...

Just for the record, I'm not convinced at all (there's probably no
point in elaborating the reasons again). I give up, though - I don't
know how to store the explicit rename information "invisibly" so that
Linus would be willing to merge commits containing it, and that would
make the whole thing pretty much pointless at least for the kernel.

I plan to revive some old patches changing large portions of cg-log
in the next few days, consequently making it trivial to add the
on-the-fly automatic renames detection to per-file cg-log.
