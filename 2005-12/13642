Hah, here we go again. :-)

Dear diary, on Wed, Dec 14, 2005 at 10:15:59PM CET, I got a letter
where "H. Peter Anvin" <hpa@zytor.com> said that...
> Did anything ever happen with that?

Linus is against it.

Cogito will do it anyway ;-), when someone sends me a nice patch or when
I get to it (probably not very soon). I imagine it like this:

(a) User can explicitly note file moves / renames. We follow those notes.
Probably the most viable for recording the notes is appending them at
the tail of the commit message.

(b) If there are no notes for the given commit, we do the rename
autodetection already implemented in GIT. If it yields something,
we follow it.
