Let's be reasonable.  I was hoping to hear from you a real-world
breakage case that I overlooked due to my lack of access to
platforms you may have access to.  I am not interested in a
theoretical failure case discussion very much.  If your
filesystem does not support executables, why do you expect
things to run from the freshly built directory to begin with?

Linkage error of git-init-db (or git wrapper) may leave the file
created but leave that in unexecutable form, which could be a
valid concern, but that would signal an error to the make during
the build stage, and "test" target depends on "all" target.

And please do not start arguing that you can cd to 't' directory
after such a build failure and manually say "make".  You can do
that without even running make at the top level and cause the
same failure.  I consider both of them pilot errors.
