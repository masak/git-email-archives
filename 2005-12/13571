Dear diary, on Tue, Dec 13, 2005 at 02:26:36AM CET, I got a letter
where Paul Dickson <paul@permanentmail.com> said that...

Both -h and --help is supported. -help should always yield "unknown
argument", but supporting it directly would be inconsistent and might
make the users think that they can actually use that for all the long
arguments.

You can make the man files by

	make doc

and install them by

	make install-doc


This isn't done by default so that you won't need asciidoc for the
build. This is exactly the same way in GIT.

Thanks for the idea:

+[ "$commitalways" ] && echo "CG: Do not save this file and just quit if
	you want to abort the commit." >>$LOGMSG

Yes. That's planned for 0.17, and I have the patch in my queue.

cg-switch, but it's not in 0.16. It's in the 0.17pre git tree and will
be in 0.17.
