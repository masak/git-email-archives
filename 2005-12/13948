No, I am not. My question really was: how do I setup a shared repository?

Now, my intention was to make it as easy as possible.

IMHO Junio is wrong here. If the repository is write-shared, then the 
working directory should be write-shared as well (or checkout should be 
DENIED), else you get all kinds of problems.

I do not understand what you mean by "repositories cloned remotely".

And if you really are working in the working directory of the shared 
repository, and a user (I know I would do it just to annoy you) pushes a 
new HEAD while you have modified files, you deserve what you get: a 
complete mess.

As for setting the umask only when writing into $GIT_DIR: unless somebody 
convinces me that it solves a problem, this is unncessary work.

You are free to ignore my warnings and my patch, I got no problem with 
that.

You are also free to wait for users to complain why this and that breaks, 
or why setting up a shared repository has to be hard, and apply my patch 
then.

Hth,
Dscho
