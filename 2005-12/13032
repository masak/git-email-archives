It turns out that this change breaks the directory/file conflict
handling in git-merge-recursive. Right now merge-recursive uses

   git-ls-tree -r -z <tree SHA1>

to get a listing of every blob object (which corresponds to files) and
every tree object (which corresponds to directories) in the tree
designated by the SHA1. With the new ls-tree behaviour we don't get
any tree objects and hence merge-recursive can't do the d/f conflict
detection as it doesn't know about the directories. As we don't track
empty directories it could be fixed within git-merge-recursive, a list
of the directory names can be obtained from the list of file names by
stripping everything after the last slash in the file names.

Should we do it that way or should ls-tree be changed?
