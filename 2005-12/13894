The patch is right, but my comment was wrong, sorry.

The actual problem detected by valgrind is that sp is dereferenced
before it's checked for the upper boundary.  So, if e.g. namelen is 6,
the code reads name[6] into ch and then leaves the loop.

That alone should be a good reason to apply this patch.
