At least two reasonably sized shops that I have worked with previously do 
not have group-per-user (and I think two others but I cannot remember 
about those) - they have centrally administered user accounts and just 
have groups like 'i am in department X', or 'I am allowed to write into 
$SOMEPROJECT cvs'.

But that's not a per-unix decision, its a per-organisation administrative 
decision.

In any case, their usage of groups wrt shared CVS would not have a problem 
with a 77x mask, though there might be problems (I haven't thought about 
it enough) with the setgid(?) bit on directories - we used to hit this 
occasionally in CVS when a directory would end up being created with a 
user's primary group rather than the 'I am allowed to write into CVS' 
group. There is too much wine in me at the moment to work out if its also 
a problem for git...
