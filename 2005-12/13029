Delight in working on free software project is you have so many
good people with you that you can have many "Aha, lightbulb!"
moments.  This is one of them for me.  I realized where the
trouble I felt when reading your table came from; it was that I
was focused on the old way the table was organized too much.

When one constructs a case table to make sure one covered
everything, one first lists the variables and the possible
values they can take, and make NxMxOxPx... grid.  In the
original table I did, I chose what is in O and A and B as my
variables (and that's where my comment about O being bit2 etc
comes from).  I did not realize the semantics and algorithm you
used can be better described by different set of variables
(namely, how ancestors match the HEAD, and how the remote
matches the HEAD, if I understand correctly).  I had trouble
understanding your version only because I kept thinking in terms
of (O,A,B).

So after thinking about that...

I think the current ordering of cases makes more sense.  If we
forget about the case labels from the original table (and the
way the original table classified cases), I suspect we could
reorganize the cases to describe the semantics even better and
clearer.  That is, not grouping by exists/missing, but grouping
by matching/unmatching.

Yeah, I now realize that.

Makes sense.  Thanks for the clarification and lightbulb moment.
