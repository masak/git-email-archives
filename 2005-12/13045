I am curious since you have also used this phrase in the past: didn't
you do your own jit porcelain once and are you saying that git does not
ship with it's own porcelain?

I see your point. I mostly intend to use it for fixing small typos in
comments and documentation. It can help to cure some "post-commit
stress".  Also I hope you will agree that it is always a good idea to
review your changes one more time although I agree it might be a little
silly.

Oh, great, thanks. I guess I should work some more on the git docs to
get to know these kind of things.
