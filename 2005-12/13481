it's now working again. Thanks. What do you think about another release?
I haven't checked the other distributions yet, but I just saw that
Debian unstable also moved to version 3.1 of bash.

There exists also another problem with the new bash. It is the broken
pipe error from cg-log.

cg-log: line 141: echo: write error: Broken pipe

The line number varies depending how much you scrolled and when you
scrolled to the end no broken pipe error comes up. Do you have any idea
on how to deal with this. I saw your comment about that bash is broken
and the extra trap command, but it doesn't help. I never saw that
problem with older versions of bash.

Regards

Marcel
