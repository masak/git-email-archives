  Hello,

  I've noticed few commits from Dec 4 landing into the git repository,
which remove various computations and corresponding lines from the
server info (3e15c67 and few ancestors). I'm curious about this - were
the computations that hugely computationally expensive? If not, wouldn't
it be better to leave it in for future use (since it doesn't cost a lot)
rather than making the future deployment of anything using this data
much harder since the server infos won't have it anymore?
