I said I tried cloning from scratch and fetching into an old one
over HTTP and succeeded, did I not?  So it does not seem to be
the case either.

My initial reaction after seeing the two other messages that
report failure to grab the tip of the master head was "Perhaps,
the usual mirroring delay".  But considering that your failure
happened way later than when the release material was placed on
the server that public servers mirror from (which was around
01:00 US/Pacific), I do not know what to think (especially
before my caffeine ;-).
