Dear diary, on Thu, Dec 15, 2005 at 02:20:28AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...

Except that I cannot do the guessing git-clone-pack does (without
fetching all the branches) - so I guess I'll make a patch tomorrow which
fixes git-clone-pack ... HEAD (probably by checking in write_one_ref()
whether it is looking at a symlink and following it first if that's the
case) and then in Cogito do

	git-symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/origin

before git-clone-pack (and repoint HEAD back after it's over). That
should do exactly what I need it to, I think.
