Not all use of delta is to produce a pack.  An empty->empty
delta is a valid two byte \0\0 sequence, and I do not see any
reason to forbid it.  Although using such delta to represent
anything in a pack does *not* make any sense as you say, it
makes other callers simpler if they do not have to check if
from_len and to_len are empty before calling the delta code.
They care about from_len=0 (or to_len=0) case to produce similar
results as from_len=1 (or to_len=1) case and do not care at all
about the produced delta being a useful one for compressed
storage purposes.

True, and the pack code is actually safe.  It punts on NULL
return, so my initial worry about packs turns out to be
unneeded.

I ended up doing both ;-).  The call site of diffcore-break was
certainly careless and broken (fixed); I've run git-grep to
check all callers to diff_delta() and the only one that did not
check the return value with NULL was the one that started with
thread.
