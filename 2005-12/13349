Wouldn't that make programs that assume that stdout (or stdin) is still 
valid get errors? I particularly want git-merge (which has a habit of 
saying "Already up-to-date. Yeeah!") to work. Also, something that assumes 
that fd 1 is somewhere to report stuff will get into trouble if it opens a 
couple of files for writing and fd 0/1 weren't open before. I seem to 
recall the standard thing for running with no I/O to be to use /dev/null 
(e.g., daemon(), if you don't keep your fds, replaces them with /dev/null).
