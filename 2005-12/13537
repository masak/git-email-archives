I agree with Nicolas.

And you don't need to.

Do what pack-objects.c does: just call "diff_delta()" and check the result 
for NULL. If the result is NULL, then you have to do some special code, 
because that means that it's a full create or a full delete (or it's an 
unchanged empty file). Regardless, it really _is_ a special case, and it 
would be silly to generate a delta for it.
