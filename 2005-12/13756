It might be even better to have some of the "safe" versions around. Ie 
something that refuses to "undo" a merge (you want to "unpull" it or 
"unmerge" it), and refuses to "undo" when there's a ORIG_HEAD around that 
implies that the last commit was a "pull" (in which case again "undo" may 
be the wrong thing to do, since it will only undo _one_ commit, even 
though the pull might have fast-forwarded a _lot_ of commits).

Of course, if we do that, we should also make sure that "git commit" 
removes ORIG_HEAD. 

Or maybe "git commit" should always _write_ ORIG_HEAD with the old head, 
so that we can always do an "undo" by doing "git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD" 
regardless of whether the last thing was a "git commit" or a "git pull".

Hmm?
