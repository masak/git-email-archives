xdelta doesn't.  It only has two functions currently:

 1) copy x bytes from offset y in source file to current position in 
    destination file;

 2) paste the x following bytes straight from the delta stream to 
    current position into the destination file.

Of course in the GIT context files are buffers.

However I added the possibility for (1) to use the destination file as 
well as the "source" file for block copy in patch_delta().  However 
diff_delta() currently doesn't use that capability.  But if it did then 
the "insert 100 spaces" would be:

	- paste \x20\x20\x20\x20 to dest
	  (delta = 5 bytes, dest = 4 bytes)

	- copy 4 bytes from offset 0 of dest to dest
	  (delta = 7 bytes, dest = 8 bytes)

	- copy 8 bytes from offset 0 of dest to dest
	  (delta = 9 bytes, dest = 16 bytes)

	- copy 16 bytes from offset 0 of dest to dest
	  (delta = 11 bytes, dest = 32 bytes)

	- copy 32 bytes from offset 0 of dest to dest
	  (delta = 13 bytes, dest = 64 bytes)

	- copy 36 bytes from offset 0 of dest to dest
	  (delta = 15 bytes, dest = 100 bytes)

And yet that could be optimized further with a better size for the 
initial paste.  However adding that capability to diff_delta() might 
make it significantly slower for still unknown gain for real life data.  
But I should write the code some day.
