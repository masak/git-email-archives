Not bad at all! I might simplify it a bit (won't need the commitmsg
parsing), and see if how fast I can make it.

Ah, no. Those have been fooled already ;-)

Of course. I'm trying to meet a few the expectations of popular cvs
clients (cli, TortoiseCVS, Eclipse, etc). If a workable git-annotate
falls out of this, oh well.

OTOH, yours didn't get included. Any particular reasons? (other than
stressing the point that you should use whatchanged/pickaxe?)

That would be cool! Though my particular implementation may be a tad
unconventional in its view of the "file history" as a strictly linear
thing. Normal git porcelains don't even blink when dealing with
branching/merging development histories.
