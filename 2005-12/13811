I am embarrassed to ask this in public, but anyway.

I was looking at "git grep -n EAGAIN" output and found that many
places check "errno == EAGAIN" without checking "errno ==
EINTR", both for read(2) and write(2).  I feel that EAGAIN is
probably not that useful (it probably would not hurt us, though)
because we do not set up nonblocking ourselves, but I am
wondering if there is particular reason to only check EAGAIN but
not EINTR, or if they are just cut and paste errors.

	apply.c:: read checks EAGAIN only, write checks both.
        cat-file.c: write checks EAGAIN only.
        copy.c:: read checks EAGAIN only, write checks both.
        mktag.c::  read checks EAGAIN only.
        pkt-line.c:: both read and write checks both.
	tar-tree.c:: write checks EAGAIN only.
        unpack-objects.c:: both read and write checks both.
