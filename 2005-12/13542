Dear diary, on Mon, Dec 12, 2005 at 09:54:20PM CET, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> said that...
> cg-clean is broken by commit 3cddede46dcd24bd7c36827ca564de23b2bb3517 -
> it removes all subdirectories when run in the top level directory.
> 
> Although it's easy to make a one-line fix, I'd prefer a solution that
> makes cg-clean potentially safer.  Since git-ls-files runs in
> subdirectories now, it's no longer needed to run anything in the top
> level directory and filter out the results.  cg-clean now changes to
> $_git_relpath on startup and never uses $_git_relpath again.

Oops! Many thanks to both this and the testcase - I was just about to
write one, because those cg-clean bugs are really quite ugly. I'll
release 0.16.2 tomorrow if no other bug will be found.
