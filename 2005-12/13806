You are right.  I do not have preference either way myself what
to put in this document.  However, the change stops recommending
rsync://, which is something I prefer to keep.

The reason for the change from public machine to master already
got an objection from Jeff.  The reasoning was because I
understand that Linus pulls from master to avoid mirroring lags
(and he publicly stated he does so number of times), and the
workflow recommended for subsystem maintainers, the primary
audience of this document, should not slow them down by pulling
from public machines.
