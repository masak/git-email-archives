Dear diary, on Thu, Dec 15, 2005 at 07:21:23AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...

Well, I like this one, but you don't need to put this to master just for
me, I'm perfectly fine with the git-clone-pack fix - both commands are
now equally simple for me to use in Cogito. (And both seem to work fine
after some basic testing.)

But you are right that git-clone-pack is basically made obsolete by this
patch, and I tend to like that fact - that's why I have slight
preference to this patch anyway, despite its size (and it's mostly
common code being moved around anyway). It's probably too late to remove
git-clone-pack altogether, but you might at least deprecate it and print
a warning when it's being ran (or at least please print a warning when
it's being ran in a repository which is already populated, which is very
likely a driver error, and I've actually made it just a minute ago ;).
