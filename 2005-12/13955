This is what I mean by shared repository.

This has some merit, for example, when some of the contributors have no 
public repository.

And then somebody comes along and allows world access by chmod(0775) and 
does not realize that *everybody* can delete packs, objects and what-nots 
in GIT_DIR.

Given the complexity we are talking about, and the needs which are not at 
all that complicated, why not just go with core.umask until somebody 
*needs* core.repositoryumask?
