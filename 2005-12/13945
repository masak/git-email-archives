Would it work to strip out all of the characters which are only in the 
disallowed character set, change the character set to ascii, and check the 
message like that? (Of course, empty or substantially reduced messages 
should be discarded instead) It looks like the non-spam in these character 
sets only has a few non-ascii characters, and those are transliterated 
into ascii nearby anyway, and I doubt that there's much spam in non-ascii 
with only a few characters in some other character set that wouldn't be 
obvious in some other way after those characters were removed.
