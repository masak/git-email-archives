Ok, what I've been doing is:
git-read-tree --reset -u <last committish>
git-checkout-index -u -f -a

to "roll-back" the index to the last "good" state.
(but I guess that has the same effect)

Then I re-tried the new git merge, and got this:

$git merge -s recursive "merge linus' tree" HEAD master 
Trying really trivial in-index merge...
fatal: Merge requires file-level merging
Nope.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/luben/bin/git-merge-recursive", line 10, in ?

The git I have is latest: b34403aa97047f90c0cdd5177e63a8e7530e3388

The former.  Simple deletion.  I've noticed that
I've those problems only when the file has been completely
deleted in the tree I'm trying to merge (from).

The index is left in a state where the file doesn't
exist in the working tree but is in the index.

Not sure if this is a general problem.  I'd like to
note though that the branches are in _different_ directories, (different index and HEAD of
course),
but everything else is shared (symlinks).

Ok, that worked.  The sequence I did is:

$git reset --hard
$git resolve HEAD master "merge linus' tree"
Trying to merge deda498710e190c7922c2634ed630ee64ce86c05 into
6fea38404a5ce270d73df9cde561135defe9ab39 using 5666c0947ede0432ba5148570aa66ffb9febff5b.
Simple merge failed, trying Automatic merge
Auto-merging MAINTAINERS.
Removing drivers/net/sk98lin/skcsum.c
fatal: merge program failed
Automatic merge failed, fix up by hand
$git-diff-files --name-status
U       drivers/net/sk98lin/skcsum.c
D       drivers/net/sk98lin/skcsum.c
$git-update-index --remove drivers/net/sk98lin/skcsum.c
$git commit -s "merge linus' tree"

And that worked.  But at some point it did the right
thing only with "git resolve ..."  What has changed?

Thanks,
   Luben
