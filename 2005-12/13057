The public kernel.org machines are actually _two_ different machines, and 
have two different addresses:

	Non-authoritative answer:
	git.kernel.org  canonical name = zeus-pub.kernel.org.
	Name:   zeus-pub.kernel.org
	Address: 204.152.191.5
	Name:   zeus-pub.kernel.org
	Address: 204.152.191.37

so with a round-robin kind of DNS resolution, you'd get alternate 
machines. Maybe one of them isn't up-to-date due to mirroring problems?

You can test by using the IP addresses explicitly, of course.

In particular, if the directory doesn't exist at all, or if the directory 
doesn't have the "git-daemon-export-ok" flag, the git daemon on the other 
end will just close the connection and refuse to talk to you (I thought 
that was preferable to give any indication of why it fails: from a 
security standpoint, you do _not_ want to be able to test if a random 
directory exists by looking at the return value of git-daemon).
