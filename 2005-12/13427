Dear diary, on Fri, Dec 09, 2005 at 03:01:23PM CET, I got a letter

Well, yes, that's the approach I advocate as well! It's precisely the
"task-based structured documentation" I talked about.

But the command listing is something different, actually the opposite:

"See, you have all those commands A, B, C. And this is what you can do
with them."

That's to say, the former requires a lot more effort and writing than
the latter and the latter has its uses as well, although I still think
the former is superior. :-)

$ whatis git
git                  (7)  - the stupid content tracker
git-add              (1)  - Add files to the index file
git-am               (1)  - Apply a series of patches in a mailbox
