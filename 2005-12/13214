This question is probably relevant only to you and people who
want to build deb themselves until you package the updated
upstream, but what is your (and others') preference on debian/
directory in what _I_ ship?

I see three possibilities:

 - Do not care, and keep them as they are as they bitrot.

 - Remove debian/ from the upstream tree.

 - You feed patches to me, and I promise you not to touch
   debian/ area, except adding a new -0 entry at the top of the
   changelog when bumping the version number up, and perhaps
   adjusting to the main Makefile changes if the solution is
   obvious.

I am neutral between the second and the third.
