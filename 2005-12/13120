Just thinking about the difference between 2-way and 3-way merge...

*Mostly* a 2-way merge is just a 3-way merge where one of the ways
is taken from the index rather than from a tree.  But there
are some subtle differences.

This diffierence is what forces octopus merge to form intermediate tree
objects when doing its merges.  If there was a way to merge directly
into the index, octopus merge wouldn't have to make intermediate tree
objects that would have to be garbage-collected later.

(Indeed, I originally assumed that Octopus did all its merges in the
index; it's only when I traced the code that I saw it calls git-write-tree
multiple times.)

Is the time saved, and space not wasted, worth implementing a 2-way merge
that more exactly matches 3-way?  It should be fairly straightforward
to share the actual merging code.

Opinions solicited.
