Hi,

What's the status of dotfile support? I can only find one thread that really
discusses the issue:

Personally I like dotfile support, and I compare it to the language encoding
issue for filenames. Linus says we should treat filenames as binary data,
and thus it won't matter what characters someone uses. I agree completely,
but by not supporting dotfiles, we're creating a big exception, in that if
a filename begins with a dot, we treat it in a much different way, in fact
we ignore it completely.

In the above quote, Linus says "if you hide your files, I really don't think
you should expect the SCM to see it". But what about the case where the
user is not the one choosing to create dotfiles? If I want to put a bunch of
config files for various apps into a git repository, I don't get to pick their
names in many cases, at least not without changing the way I invoke my apps
(or the scripts that do it for me). But it's still worthwhile to have those
config files in version control. It makes it much easier to experiment with
new tools, recover from my mistakes, and share my successes with others.

So that's my pitch: Leaving out dotfile support seems like it creates an
unnecessary limitation that eliminates some valid uses of git.

Be well,
Zack
