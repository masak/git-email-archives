Normally we suggest upstream to not ship a debian/ directory at all, and
I would prefer that.  But I can understand that people may got used to
it, and prefer to build the packages on their own.  So I'm also fine
with feeding you with patches, but need to get 0.99.9l into the Debian
archive first (already prepared, waiting in a 'new packages' queue), and
then adapt the build process to use the debian/ directory in the git
tarball, instead of the current tarball-in-tarball approach.

This may take some days, and there are major changes to the debian/
directory as I personally don't use the usual debhelper approach.

Thanks, Gerrit.
