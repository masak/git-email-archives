This trivial patch fails to do that correctly, but maybe somebody could 
fix it. 

The problem is not that it generates GIT_VERSION wrong. The problem is 
two-fold:
 - it should notice when "git-describe" doesn't exist, and fall back on 
   the old less-than-descriptive behaviour
 - it doesn't do dependencies correctly (ie it should now make "git" 
   depend on the version number, but it doesn't, so it doesn't re-build 
   git after a commit/pull)

but at least it shows the _idea_ of using git-describe.

With this I get

	[torvalds@g5 git]$ git --version
	git version v1.0.4-g6e9961d6

which I think is better than "1.0.GIT" which doesn't say anything about 
what the _actual_ version was.

(Ignore the particular SHA1 hash - it has my local commit that you can't 
re-create that just created that git-describe thing. You'll get your own 
version number).
