No, "git merge" should be fine. It's what "git pull" ends up doing 
internally, which is why I suspected an old git version: "git merge" 
should be well-tested, since it's very much what I end up using every day 
when I pull stuff.

Ok, that's correct.

git-merge does:

	common=$(git-merge-base --all $head "$@")

and then it _should_ have triggered this case:

	case "$#,$common,$no_commit" in
	..
	1,"$1",*)
		# If head can reach all the merge then we are up to date.
		# but first the most common case of merging one remote
		echo "Already up-to-date."
		dropsave
		exit 0
		;;
	..

and thus never have created any merge messages.

That's what I get when I try this:

	git checkout -b test-merge 0a47c906342e2447003e207d23917dfa5c912071
	git merge "Testing merging" HEAD d2149b542382bfc206cb28485108f6470c979566

results in a very immediate

	"Already up-to-date."

message. Does it do that for you too?

I tested not only with current git, but also the gits that were valid on 
Nov 29 and Nov 30. All of them did this.

Hmm. It really looks like it should have been impossible to generate that 
commit with current git, which is why I'm still a bit suspicious.

I think this list has been pretty responsive to reports of strange 
behaviour, so yes.
