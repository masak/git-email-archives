Sorry... it was one edit session while I made all the corrections,
and it was just more natural...

"I want to do X and Y but not Z.  What commands are worth knowing?"

I have 106 git-* commands available to me (my document covers 105;
I'll have to find the extra), and the biggest question I have is
"how many of those man pages can I get away with NOT reading?"

Heck, that categorized list is what I started out writing, and I happen
to think it's the most important part of the whole document.

The man page tells me HOW to execute a command.  But before I'm ready for
that level of detail, I need to figure out WHICH command to execute.
To be specific, I need to know the terrain just well enough so I can
plan a route from where I am to where I want to be.  Then I can look
into the details of each step.

But without that overview, my trip is going to take me into a lot of dead
ends, because I'm executing commands that I think are getting me closer,
but I have the wrong mental model of what "close" is.

Or perhaps I found one command that sort-of does what I want an
missed the one that works better.


(BTW, don't you mean "whatis -w git\*"?)
