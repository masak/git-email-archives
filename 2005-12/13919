Thanks.

This fixes when there is ".git/objects/packs/junk-X.pack", so in
that sense it is a real fix and I'll take it.

However, I feel a bit uneasy about this whole thing.  The core
does not care how you name your packs, as long as .pack and .idx
files have the same prefix, but we started relying on the prefix
being "pack-" followed by 40 hexadecimal digits since we started
packed repository support in http-fetch, and we also allowed
sha1_pack_name() function that shares the assumption to sneak
into the real core part of the system around the same time (end
of July 2005).  git-repack and git-verify-pack stay ignorant
about this prefix convention and I think that is a good
property.  However, we might be better off if we declare that
the pack files *must* be named following that convention
(currently nobody enforces it, but as long as the user uses "git
repack" to create packs, the packs automatically follow that
convention), and make check_packed_git_idx() reject a packfile
whose name does not begin with "pack-" or the 40 hexdigits that
follow does not match the hash of the object names the index
records.  If we go that route, then this patch becomes unneeded;
more extensive check needs to be done in check_packed_git_idx().

Thoughts?
