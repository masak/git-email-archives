FWIW, fourthed ;-)

commit c894168631e4b7da66ed3993a4c92380d38599a8
Author: Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>
Date:   Wed Dec 21 22:33:37 2005 -0800

    Versioning scheme changes.
    
    HPA suggests it is simply silly to imitate Linux versioning
    scheme where the leading "2" does not mean anything anymore, and
    I tend to agree.
    
    The first feature release after 1.0.0 will be 1.1.0, and the
    development path leading to 1.1.0 will carry 1.0.GIT as the
    version number from now on.  Similarly, the third maintenance
    release that follows 1.0.0 will not be 1.0.0c as planned, but
    will be called 1.0.3.  The "maint" branch will merge in fixes
    and immediately tagged, so there is no need for 1.0.2.GIT that
    is in between 1.0.2 (aka 1.0.0b) and 1.0.3.
