But you also have commands of interest or not to different classes
of users.

Some users want to track someone else's repository.
Others want to generate their repository from scratch.
Or maybe import some history from CVS.

Some users spend all day applying patches.
Some spend all day creating patches.
Some just want to retrieve the kernel and run "git bisect"
to help the kernel developers.  They will neither generate
nor apply patches.
Some want access to a developer's git repository to test
bleeding-edge drivers.

Some folks want to set up remote access to a shared repository
within a development group.
Some folks want to set up an anonymous git server.

Et cetera.  There are many different constituencies, who will
want access to a different subset of the commands.

That much, I definitely agree with.  Mixing the two is confusing.
