List the tags you want pushed. 

The git transport (whether over ssh or locally) will default to updating 
only _shared_ references. So any heads that you have updated it will 
update by default. But if you want to create a new branch or tag on the 
other end, you need to list it explicitly (and once you do, it won't do 
the default ones at all).

Now, "git fetch" has a "--tags" argument that is shorthand for "all tags", 
and I think we should add that to "git send-pack" too just because it's 
both a common operation _and_ it mirrors "git fetch". But in the meantime 
you can hack around it with something like

	git send-pack <destination> $(cd .git/refs/ ; echo tags/*)


which is a silly way to list all tags ;)
