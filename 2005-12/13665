Dear diary, on Thu, Dec 15, 2005 at 02:45:32AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...

Ah, play with the words. Sure I'm cloning - however I'm not cloning
a repository but a branch. In Cogito world, that's the only thing that
makes sense to clone, in GIT world it's more complicated (you don't
always clone the whole repository there either, since git-clone-pack
lets you narrow down the refs).

I'll then try to extend git-fetch-pack instead. I'll send some fix for
git-clone-pack anyway, though. ;-)
