Shouldn't you make "git.c" return an error too, so that "git-describe" and 
"git describe" both fail properly?

I realize that you'd want to do your patch _too_ (in case somebody has an 
old version of "git" installed), but I just think it would be sensible to 
fix the problem that causes this in the first place..

Continuing to output to stdout rather than stderr is probably a good idea 
(so that it's easy to do "git help | less" or something), but yeah, I 
think an unrecognized command should at least return an error.
