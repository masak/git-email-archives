The nice thing about it is that you can move huge directories around,
or multiple files/dirs at once, and it will do the right thing. E.g.
	git-mv -k foo* bar/
will only move files which are version controlled.

It is actually a 3-step process: rename, delete old, add new.
Perhaps it should be noted that this has nothing to do with any
explicit renaming feature like in other SCMs.
