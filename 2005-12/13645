  Hello,

  this is Cogito version 0.16.2, the next stable release of the
human-friendly version control UI for the Linus' GIT tool. Share
and enjoy at:

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/

  Very few changes since the last release - one testcase, trivial fix,
documentation improvements. And one important bugfix! If you are a
cg-clean user, certainly upgrade - cg-clean in 0.16.1 had a serious bug
which would cause it remove all subdirectories when running from the
source root with the -d option - which is rather nasty if you have any
uncommitted local changes there.

  Now we finally have a testcase for cg-clean, and the cg-clean code was
further tweaked to reduce potential for any more code mistakes. The
major reason for both 0.16.1 and 0.16.2 were cg-clean bugs, but
hopefully no more problems are waiting for us in this realm, and the
rest of Cogito seems to be thankfully pretty stable throughout the 0.16
line, so I expect things to finally calm down a bit here.

  I spent the last two hours making a large patch fixing all potentially
whitespace-unsafe Cogito code, but I've decided to keep it for 0.17 only
- Cogito meeting with whitespaces is a very rare occasion, and such
a large patch is bound to contain some new bugs coming from trivial
mistakes and such.

  Also, Cogito is now very ineffective when cloning big-packed
repositories over the git protocol or over ssh, since git-fetch-pack
unpacks the objects on the local side, which bogs things down a lot and
makes the repository grow into enormous proportions - I'm not yet sure
if I will backport the fix to 0.16 since I want to be maximally careful
not to gravely break anything again and keep 0.16 as stable as possible.
(Hm. Call this "the Debian dilemma". ;-)

  The new stuff since 0.16.1 is:

Pavel Roskin:
      cg-clean test
      cg-clean: be safer by running everything from relpath

Petr Baudis:
      cg-clean testcase: Minor tidyup
      cg-clean testcase: Clarify description
      Fixed cg-clean removing ALL subdirs when invoked from root
            (Discovered and originally fixed by Pavel Roskin.)
      Fix cg-status reporting every merge as a squash-merge
      Improve cg-admin-setuprepo documentation
      In the cg-commit text, give the user hint on how to abort
      cogito-0.16.2

  Happy hacking,
