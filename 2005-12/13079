Easier to read is:

	$ git-diff-files --name-status

which would tell you that there two files have conflicting
changes:

U       arch/arm/configs/poodle_defconfig
U       drivers/atm/atmdev_init.c

and you would hopefully not see anything else (you saw tons of
paths only because you compared against HEAD, which shows not
just conflicts but everything the merge brought in).

	$ git diff arch/arm/configs/poodle_defconfig drivers/atm/atmdev_init.c

would give you the diff between your version (before merging)
and the half-merged file with conflict markers.  Resolve them
just like you would resolve conflicting changes.  I would
usually just open these files in an editor, and pick one of the
sections between <<< == >>> these markers.

One nifty tool I saw suggested on the list recently was xxdiff:

	$ xxdiff -U arch/arm/configs/poodle_defconfig

No matter how you would resolve, the first goal of yours is to
get these files in your working tree into a good shape, which
may involve compiling and testing.  Once you have these files in
a good enough shape, you tell git that you are done with them:

	$ git update-index \
        	arch/arm/configs/poodle_defconfig drivers/atm/atmdev_init.c

and commit.

	$ git commit

The commit message editor would loudly warn you that you are
committing a merge, but that is OK because that is what you are
doing.  You might want to describe how you resolved (which side
you picked) the conflicting changes in the log, in addition to
the standard boilerplate "merged that branch" message.
