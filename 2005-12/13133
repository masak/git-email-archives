In case I did not make it clear: I was not mad or something like that. I 
only see 3 ways to go about that particular problem:

- maintain your private config.mak
- maintain your private Make (shell script)
- maintain your private Makefile

I actually did the third way for a while, always merging the newest 
version. But all of a sudden -- when I was working on another project, 
which *has* a config.mak -- I had the idea to do the first way.

Actually, the second way falls a little bit short for some of my 
applications: I sometimes override settings in the first part of the 
Makefile. This is not possible with Make.

As mentioned, with the difference that you just can't override some things 
in Make.

... which might have another (desired) effect: the structure of the 
Makefile is better. More organized.

Besides, if you change things in an organized Makefile, you tend to be a 
little bit more careful where you put things, so the cost of maintaining 
is not really high (happened to me...).

Hth,
