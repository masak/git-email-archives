I know, I know, use pickaxe :-)

Any suggestions as to how to implement a not-too-slow annotate that
looks reasonable enough so as to fool real cvs clients? Let's assume
I'll have the "per-file-version numbers" to translate commit SHA1s
into cvs-ish version numbers in a magic hat, right next to the fluffy
bunnies.

Suggestions of GIT machinery that would shortcut the trip from

     git-rev-list HEAD $path

to a annotate-ish output. Did I dream it or is qgit showing something
annotate-ish in its screenshots?

Note! Just told a white lie: I won't be actually using git-rev-list.
Instead, I'll have a rev list that will gloss over branched
development, picking only one "path" of the history every time
(initially using the algorithm formerly known as rand() ) , and
showing merge commits as one.

cheers,


martin
