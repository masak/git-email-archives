The original patch hasn't been merged, nor (for what I see) anything else to 
fix this problem has been done.

I assume the patch was lost waiting for the discussion to settle down, but the 
patch can be merged, even changing the default choices in any way (see 
below).

Also, another note: I just found Bruce Eckel mentioning pychecker, which is a 
static code checker for Python (to perform the checks a compiler would 
normally do). I've not the time to investigate more myself, but I hope it can 
be useful to you.
