Side note: one simple solution for "socklen_t" is to just replace it with 
"int".

Any operating system where socklen_t is anything else than "int" is 
terminally broken. The people who introduced that typedef were confused, 
and I actually had to argue with them that it was fundamentally wrong: 
there is no other valid type than "int" that makes sense for it.

In case anybody cares: not only is "int" obviously "big enough" even on 
some theoretical 16-bit architecture, so there's never any real _reason_ 
to use anything else.

But more importantly, the core BSD networking functions have historically
had declarations like

	int accept(int s, struct sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen);

which means that if 'socklen_t' is ever anything else than "int", you'd 
break all old applications. For no good reason. 

Ergo, any operating system that has socklen_t != int is so broken that 
it's simply not worth playing with.

(POSIX for a short while had _defined_ it to be the same as "size_t", I 
really had to scream at some people over it, and told people that Linux 
would never do anything that stupid. Apparently Linux was the first 
64-bit operating system that people actually ever tried to use).
