* The fourth minor fix release, GIT 0.99.7d, is available at the
  usual places.

  RPMs and Debs are found in http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/

  With git:

  $ git fetch http://kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git tag v0.99.7d
  $ git checkout -b <new-branch> v0.99.7d

  Fixes since 0.99.7c are:

  - Fix show-branch output that named commits incorrectly.
  - Fix git-grep -e not passing -e to underlying grep.

* Recent updates to the master branch includes:

  - The GIT_VERSION is now 0.99.7.GIT (thanks Pasky for the
    idea).

  - The symlinks for backward compatible names are not installed
    anymore (but existing ones are not automatically removed).

  - git-diff-* family acquired a new option, --name-status, to
    show the status and name for changed files.  Also -l<num>
    option disables rename/copy detection when the number of
    rename target candidates are more than <num> (idea by Linus
    some time ago).

* Proposed updates, not yet graduated to the master branch
  includes:

  - git-merge fix, not to require a clean tree.

  - Likewise for git-revert and git-cherry-pick fix, not to
    require a clean tree.

  - Use git-merge from git-pull, again.

  - A couple of test fixes for further Solaris portability.

  - update-index takes -z --stdin to read NUL terminated list of
    paths from the standard input instead of from the command
    line.  This is to help platforms with xargs that cannot grok
    -0.  git-commit is updated to use this.
