Hi,

Petr Baudis:

OK, OK, I'll shut up already... my fault, I guess, from not having scanned
the whole file.

There are enough people out there whose tempdir is named "Temporary
Items" or similar, so I guess somebody (i.e. me ;-) should walk through
the shell scripts and try not to get brain lock-up as he scans for that
sort of problem.

Of course, I also need a few hours to complete the SVN interpreter, and
a few hours to finalize a draft implementation of a *real* git library,
and ... well, if somebody wants the stuff badly enough to actually pay
for it I'm listening.
