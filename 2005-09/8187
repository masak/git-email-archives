Junio tested some of the multiple common ancestor cases with your
version of read-tree and reported his results in
<7virxeycod.fsf@assigned-by-dhcp.cox.net>.

The two cases my algorithm merges cleanly and git-resolve-script do
not merge cleanly are 0e396ee43e445cb7c215a98da4e76d0ce354d9d7 and
0c168775709faa74c1b87f1e61046e0c51ade7f3. Both of them have two common
ancestors. The second one have, as far as I know, not been tested with
your read-tree.

The merge cases reported by Tony Luck and Len Brown are both cleanly
merged by my code.

You are probably right about the maintainer trees. I should have a
look at some of them. Do you know any specific repositories with
interesting merge cases?
