Nope, it's not.

It just depends on which IP address you happen to get when you look at 
www.kernel.org.

www.kernel.org resolves to two addresses:

	Name:   zeus-pub.kernel.org
	Address: 204.152.191.5
	Name:   zeus-pub.kernel.org
	Address: 204.152.191.37

and the .5 address is working, but the .37 address has the broken mirror.

I thought hpa took it out of service while it was re-syncing, but 
apparently not.
