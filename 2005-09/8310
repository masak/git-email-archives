No, I just stated my view poorly.

You cannot do pull into a naked one, but you can still fetch
into it.  My comment Johannes was responding to was what to do
when you do 'git fetch' into the repository associated with your
working tree and your branch is fast forwarded.  We obviously
want to prevent it from happening.  However, it is OK to do so
if the fetch is happening into a naked one and I was wondering
if there is a reliable way to tell that situation and allowing
that.
