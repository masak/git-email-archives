No, the intention really is to remove the ".git" at the end. At least 
that's how I use it.

I like seeing my merges say

    Merge branch 'for-linus' from master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/roland/infiniband

even though the _real_ directory was ".../infiniband.git/", simply because 
the ".git" doesn't really add any extra information when you're already in 
git.

_outside_ of git, the ".git" tells you something: it tells you that you're 
entering a git archive. But when merging in git, that part is kind of 
taken for granted, isn't it?

This also matches what "git-receive-pack" and "git-upload-pack" does:

	...
        /* chdir to the directory. If that fails, try appending ".git" */
        if (chdir(dir) < 0) {
                if (chdir(mkpath("%s.git", dir)) < 0)
                        die("unable to cd to %s", dir);
        }

        /* If we have a ".git" directory, chdir to it */
        chdir(".git");
	...

Note how it _both_ will append ".git" to the directory name (if it can't 
find one without ".git" _and_ will try to chdir to a ".git" directory 
_within_ the directory name.

So if you use the native pack ssh interfaces, you really can say

	git pull master.kernel.org:.../infiniband

because the tools (well, the "native pack" ones - not the http/rsync/scp
ones) will automatically DTRT.
