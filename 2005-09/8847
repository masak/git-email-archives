hello,

attached are two patches.

the first is an updated implementation of CURLDIR support (for those who
have libcurl outside their library search path)

the second changes cmd-rename.sh so that it only adds symlinks to
executables that actually exist (eg. when building with NO_CURL,
git-http-pull would still be created).

another issue I had was that mailinfo uses strcasestr, which isn't in
solaris' libc (and not in posix according to
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2005-08/msg00076.html). I
disabled it in my build for now, and might come up with a patch later,
unless someone beats me to it.
