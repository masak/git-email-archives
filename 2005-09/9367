Do you want to guard the repository from malicious users?  Or is
it enough to guard a casual/careless user from making mistakes?

If one has commit privileges, then one can already do enough
harm to the project without being able to remove objects nor
updating a ref with non-fast-forward ref.  So let's assume for
now that malicious users are not something we worry about.  In
that case, "working on" might be too scary a word.  I think most
of the pieces are already there and you only need to assemble
them and write a howto ;-).

 - Place the users that has write access to the repository in
   the same Unix group, and have the repository owned by that
   group;

 - Give the users ssh access, perhaps with authorized_keys set
   up to only allow running git-receive-pack and nothing else
   (like normal shell access);

 - Set up hooks/update to make sure the ref updates are fast
   forward.  Additionally, you could set up a mapping that says
   which user can/cannot update which refs if you wanted to.
