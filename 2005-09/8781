Well, it looks like some other file has _exactly_ the same contents as the 
new "Dependencies", which means that git notices that the blob isn't 
actually new.

Which doesn't surprise me at all - you've got a lot of projects there that 
seem to have a Dependencies thing. Why wouldn't some other project have 
the exact same ones?
