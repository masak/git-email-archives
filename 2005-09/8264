It is defined in annotate.h as a typedef:

class ReachInfo {
public:
	ReachInfo() {};
	ReachInfo(SCRef s, int i, int t) : sha(s), id(i), type(t) {};
	~ReachInfo() {};
	QString sha;
	int id, type;
	QStringList roots;
};
typedef QValueVector<ReachInfo> ReachList;


then used in annotate.cpp:

 *   along with this program; if not, write to the                         *

 ***************************************************************************/
#include <qapplication.h>
#include "git.h"
#include "annotate.h"

.....

void Annotate::run(SCRef file, SList shaHist, AnnotateHistory& ah) {

	QString d, diffTarget;
	QStringList tmp;
	int pos, removed = 0, annID = 0;
	ReachList rl;
....

Please, what compiler version and qt dev libraries do you have?

But in any case it is very strange..... really I have no idea now.....I have to think
about it....

P.S: Due to a subtle but nasty bug that I found too late I have upgraded the release to
qgit-0.94.1 I strongly suggest to upgrade.

I am very sorry for this.
