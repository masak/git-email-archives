i measured this using the following test...

i have a linux kernel git repository under control of stgit and it has 
about 70 patches in it.  i did an "stg status" to heat the page cache. 
i popped all the patches, then did an "stg pull origin".

i started oprofile, and did an "stg push -a".  it took about 9 minutes.

i stopped oprofile and looked at the results.  roughly 65% of the total 
CPU time was spent in libc:memmove.  after instrumenting git, i 
determined that in the "stg push" case the critical memmove was the one 
in add_cache_entry.

note that i'm not saying that the 9 minutes of wall clock time was 
entirely due to CPU... catalin has been steadily improving "stg push" so 
this time has shortened by more than half, recently.  but i do notice 
that working in a kernel repository is significantly slower than working 
in my git or stgit source repositories, which are smaller by far.  the 
small repositories behave just as i expect, the tools respond quite 
snappily.

i'm not married to splay trees.  i think we should explore several 
different data structures before picking one, and this one sounds 
reasonable to try.
