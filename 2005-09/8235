True.  Before 'git-merge' hits the "master" branch I should
remove 'git-merge-resolve' from the strategies list (or rename
'git-merge-multibase' to it).  I have them separately only
because I wanted to be able to see how differently they perform
by saying:

    git merge -s resolve blah...
    git merge -s multibase blah...

I agree it can be used that way, but nobody seems to use it for
that purpose as far as I can tell hence my earlier comment.  But
let's leave the door open by having them as independent
options.
