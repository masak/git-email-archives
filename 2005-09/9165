Dear diary, on Fri, Sep 23, 2005 at 11:34:16AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Yes, exactly that. You get it by doing cg-clone -l /local/path.  O(1)
cloning, but it has its downsides and dangers which I tried to describe
in the cg-clone documentation.

Just that if the reference pointer did not change, you don't try to pull
any objects. Speeds things up somewhat, and now it should always work
(well, cg-fetch has -f which makes it always try objects as well, in
case something went wrong anyway).

Good.

cg-clone just basically does cg-init && cg-fetch, and I'd really want to
keep it on that. So effectively, cg-clone over http just runs
git-http-fetch and trusts it to do the right thing (reasonably fast).

Recursive wget is used only for fetching tags (and it actually seems to
work nicely, when directory listing is enabled, obviously). Yes, I
should teach cg-fetch about info/refs too.
