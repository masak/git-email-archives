Yes, for git-rev-list it makes sense, because that already more or less
"serializes" things by date.

The thing is, it may have sensible behaviour for CVS, but only because CVS 
doesn't have any notion of concurrent development (even a branch isn't 
concurrent - it's totally separate, and when you merge it, it becomes just 
one big diff at the time of the merge).

So I'd love to have

	git diff yesterday..

but the fact is, there's no sensible semantics for it. _which_ yesterday? 
There might be five different points that are "close to 24 hours ago", 
along five different paths backwards in the history.

I suspect that the date-based thing really doesn't make sense as a
revision, only as a git log cut-off (ie the "--min-age=" flag is as close
to sensibility as you can get).
