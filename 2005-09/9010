Dear diary, on Tue, Aug 30, 2005 at 04:20:40PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Thanks for the patch - it'd be actually very nice to get rid of the
complexity. But more than that, I want to be consistent - so do all the
GIT core commands work in subdirectories by now, or only a subset of
them? I'd hate to have half of the scripts stay in the subdirectory
and half use the Cogito's old relpath logic, so it's either everything
or anything from my POV.

Thanks,
