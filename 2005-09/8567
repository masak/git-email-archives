Dear diary, on Wed, Sep 14, 2005 at 11:31:56PM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...

well, that should be the case for all the methods but rsync. Actually,
it's not the case for local pulls now either, because git-local-pull
wasn't able to deal with packs, but I think that's fixed by now so I'll
reenable that.

Well, there's that update-server-info thing. It'd be nice if
git-send-pack could call that automagically or something, so it's kept
up-to-date. But I have no idea about how expensive can the command
actually be.
