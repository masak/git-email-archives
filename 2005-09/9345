Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 27, 2005 at 01:36:01AM CEST, I got a letter
where "H. Peter Anvin" <hpa@zytor.com> told me that...

Yes, makes sense. In the past it seemed like a nice idea to only create
it when we have to, but it has way too many downsides and if you still
have a plausible reason not to want the tag objects, you're special
enough to fallback to the lowlevel tools.

cg-tag now always creates tag objects.

Thanks for the feedback,
