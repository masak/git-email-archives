I was sadly mistaken.  It doesn't seem to be so well-used after all.
Here's a list of applications that use it:

* mutt (the only one that really counts)
* darcs (which also uses DARCS_EMAIL)
* various debian utilities (who cares)
* Vim's changelog package (which I have written, so that doesn't count)

Quite a sad list, so I suppose that there's really no point in it...,
