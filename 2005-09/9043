Looks fine to me, although it should possibly share the code somehow with 
write_sha1_file().

Well, with verify_pack(), anyway. No need to prepare a command line, fork, 
exec, and parse it, just to call a library function.

I think we want to have the partial file in the destination location, and 
maybe teach http-fetch about resuming the download, since it takes 
significant time to download a single pack, and it would be nice to be 
able to use the part we've got if we get interrupted.
