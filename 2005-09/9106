In this case extraction went fine, except for the warning message.

I had other error reports from customers befroe, where unpacking  the
tarballs failed - instead of the origianl source tree just a bunch of
*.data  and  *.paxheader  were created; error messages in these cases
looked like this:

tar: pax_global_header: Unknown file type 'g', extracted as normal file

[But this was with older versions of git / cogito, so I'm not sure if
this still applies.]

I think animal testing is a terrible idea; they get all  nervous  and
give the wrong answers.
