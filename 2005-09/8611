I've been asked whether I can provide e-mail notification
when I take patches into my tree.  I took a look at the
existing hooks, and I don't think that I want to do this
when I first make a commit ... sometimes I back these out
again if there is a problem when I test.

So I think that what I want is to produce a list of changes
that I commited when I push a new tree out to kernel.org.
But ... such a push usually contains lots of flow-through
changes that I pulled from Linus ... so a simple:

 $ git-rev-list --no-merges newhead ^oldhead

gives a long list of changes.  I'd like to filter out
all the ones that weren't commited by me.  Is there an
argument to git-rev-list that will just print the entries
where I'm listed as the commiter, or do I have to use
"--pretty-full" and write a little script to do the trim?

Or is there some other way to do this?
