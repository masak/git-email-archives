Hmmm.  Maybe this is all begging a form of documentation
down the "Best Practices" line, or "Tips I Learned
By Reading Junio and Linus Postings on Git". :-)

Heh.  I read his problem description too, and it sounded
remarkably close to the HTTP pull problems that I had
been victimized by, thus converting me to rsync (for now).

I have recloned entire repos due to the aborted pulls
being left in an inconsistent state.  In fact, that is
what lead me to find git-fsck-cache, which I was expecting
to sort out the missing pieces and detect an incomplete
clone.  Perhaps marking it as "needing completion" via
another clone/pull effort.  Dunno.
