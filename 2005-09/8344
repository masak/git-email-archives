Dear diary, on Fri, Sep 02, 2005 at 12:31:38PM CEST, I got a letter
where Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it> told me that...

What about just by default doing full-blown detection, with an optional
flag to do no detection (to produce patch-compatible diffs)? I don't
think Cogito users usually need a more fine-tuned settings.

Obviously in that case we also have to fix cg-patch to process renames
and stuff - but we should do that anyway. :-)
