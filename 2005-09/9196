That's actually how I use git, and it works for me. (To be precise, I 
have:

 ~/git/project.git/{objects,refs,info}

and I have

 ~/working/git/current-work/, with .git/{objects,refs,info} symlinks to 
                              the above.

git fetch works fine, with the exception that remotes aren't shared 
between working trees.

I assume you mean with rsync? The current git-http-fetch won't try any 
objects if the ref didn't change (or, for that matter, if we have a 
different ref that's the same), and the old one would make a local check 
for the objects before trying to downlaod anything.
