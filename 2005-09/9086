Not to use git for this.

Seriously, that's what I have switched to doing, and it's so much
easier.  I use quilt to manage patches from the community, and Andrew
pulls them into to the -mm releases, and all users can test them.  I
keep them up to date with the git snapshots, which handles the different
merge and fuzz issues very well.

Then, when it's time to merge with Linus, I pick and choose the patches
that I want to send off, create a git tree, add them to the tree, and
send them off.

It's ended up saving me a lot of time (I used to do what Karsten is
trying to do with bitkeeper, and it had the same issues that he is
running into) and would recommend this situation for anyone who wants to
keep patches from being merged immediatly (like he is trying to do.)

thanks,
