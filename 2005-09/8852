  Hello,

  after today's another confrontation with angry mob of real-world
Cogito users, I decided to revive the old discussion about what part of
the GECOS field should be used to prefill GIT_*_NAME. Linus stated in
<Pine.LNX.4.58.0504171636590.7211@ppc970.osdl.org> that he does not want
to cut based on ',', because it might throw away the first name of gecos
fields in the "Torvalds, Linus" name.

  Well, I have to say that from the GECOS fields I saw, none use that
format, but a lot of them used the realname,phone,something,phone,...
format. The other point is, that users usually do not expect their phone
number to end up in their name information in GIT commits, which results
in a very unpleasant surprise (doubly so due to the immutable GIT
nature). Yes, they should check after the first commit if they are happy
with everything, and yes, GECOS is world-readable and therefore they
shouldn't put information they don't want to be public to it. Still they
do and I think GIT shouldn't make them unpleasant surprises.

  So my proposal (patch will follow soon) is to cut everything after the
first , or ; from the GECOS field. These are the usual delimiters used
in the GECOS field, and hopefully this will prevent polluting the
realname fields of commit headers with crap and surprising the users.
In the (I think rather rare) situation of the "Baudis, Petr"-like GECOS
fields, this will just result in only the surname being in the realname
field, which seems to be much less harmful and comparably less evil to
me. 

  Opinions?
