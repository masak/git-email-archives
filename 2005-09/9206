Now, I'm not a big fan of windows ("No, really? Tell us more!") but I'd 
actually like it if the _core_ git stuff worked in as wide a variety of 
situations as possible. Screw the shell scripts and the daemon or 
secondary things like that which windows users might as well generate 
their own stuff for, but I'd hope the really core stuff would work.

If I understood correctly, you said that "git-diff-tree" doesn't work due
to the fork/mmap issue. Now, I assume that means that it's the builtin
diff that has problems. 

As far as I can tell, we can solve that two ways:

 - make Windows always use the external diff program. That may be the 
   right thing to do, since then the fork() just turns into a regular 
   fork+exec, which is how windows works anyway.

 - look at doing the diff internally.

I'm wondering if there is some stupid way to turn a diff generated by 
diff_delta() into a line-based one? If you have the original file and the 
xdiff, I think we should be able to just walk the original file and output 
a unified diff.

Davide, maybe I'm being stupid, but I'm thinking that it might be possible
to generate a -u3 diff by basically walking the xdiff file in a linear
fashion: if the edits are in strictly ascending order, we could walk the
original file one line at a time, and keeping a buffer of the three last
lines. Then, when the file offset hits the next "edit" in the xdiff, we
start generating a line-based diff (and use the previous three lines as
the context).

Does that sound possible? Maybe somebody has even done it? Is it a stupid 
idea?

I realize that it might not generate the same diff as GNU diff would do, 
and maybe it's really nasty, but it sounds like it _could_ be a "cheap" 
way of generating diffs, considering that we have something that already 
generates xdiffs..
