The README doesn't talk about teams with "peer" access to a shared repo.
It took me a while to figure our the /right/ way to do it. Document for
future generations and general happiness.

+Using Cogito for Team Work
+--------------------------
+
+A small team with SSH access to a shared server can use Cogito in a way 
+similar to traditional CVS over SSH. 
+
+If you are bootstrapping the project, and you have a local Cogito working copy,
+you must set up the shared repository and push a local head to it.
+
+To set up the shared repository, for example in 
+remoteserver:/var/git, login to the remote server and do
+
+        $ umask  002
+        $ mkdir /var/git
+        $ chgroup gitcommit /var/git
+        $ chmod  2775 /var/git
+        $ mkdir -p /var/git/projectname.git
+        $ GIT_DIR=/var/git/projectname.git git-init-db
+        
+Note: All the developers with "commit" access must belong to the gitcommit
+group and have a 002 umask on the remote server.
+
+Going back to your Cogito working copy, run 
+
+        $ git-push  remoteserver:/var/git/projectname.git master branchname
+
+Now your other teammembers can start working with you, doing
+
+         $ cg-clone git+ssh://remoteserver/var/git/project.git#branchname localdir
+
+And when they are ready to push their work onto the shared repository, just do
+
+         $ cg-update
+         $ cg-push
+
