Essentially what I want to do is:

git-ls-files --others | xargs git-update-index --add --
git-ls-files --deleted | xargs git-update-index --remove --
git-ls-files --modified | xargs git-update-index --

This will completely resync the index and cache to the working tree 
state after applying a patch.  git-update-index --refresh only updates 
the stat info in the index.  It does _not_ write a new cache object if 
the file contents have actually changed.

Cogito would benefit from this too.  It currently uses git-diff-index 
and some ugly sed expressions in cg-commit to detect modified files.

If your objection is to calling the files modifed, then call it dirty or 
something else.
