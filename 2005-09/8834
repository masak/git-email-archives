But rpm resolves dependencies by looking in the rpm database not by
checking the filesystem.   You can actually disable the automatic perl
dependency detection when creating the rpm, but that probably isn't
desirable.

At least on Red Hat/Fedora machines you can create your own rpms directly
from CPAN so it's not too big a restriction:

$ cpan2rpm String::ShellQuote
$ cd ~/rpm/RPMS/noarch
$ sudo rpm -ivh perl-String-ShellQuote-1.03-1.noarch.rpm

Which is all you need to download, package and install the perl module.

There is special handling for perl detection within the rpmbuild
procedure, so perl will be added automatically where many others won't be.
