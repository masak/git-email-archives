and I think you peraphs have the flag 
edit->settings->general->'load file names in background' unset.

Currently annotation filters out file history looking only at loaded file names, so no file names
means no annotation and this could explaing what you have seen.

Make annotation working also without file names loaded is on my TODO list, in the meantime,
you should need to set the flag and eventually refresh (F5), before to try annotate.

It's my bad I didn't documented properly this requirement.

Indeed the flag 'load file names in background' _should_ always be set.
 
You need to unset the flag only for very very big archives like the whole 
linux history tree (kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git) so to keep
memory requirement at a minimum.

Please, let me know if this clears the things a bit.
