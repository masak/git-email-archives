Dear diary, on Mon, Sep 26, 2005 at 06:44:04PM CEST, I got a letter

This isn't too harmful. It just means that you have a tag ref and the
corresponding tag object, but not the commit tagged by that object.
This is nothing harmful as long as you don't try to reference the tag,
and if you don't have the commit object already, it's actually not quite
likely that you would, since you don't have the branch the bug belongs
to anyway. I'll hopefully fix this bug during the weekend.
