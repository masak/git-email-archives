because my only use for git is with monotone's git import.

the only case that comes to mind is where you want to link git against
a library which is at a different location now than it is later, eg. in
conjunction with DESTDIR or similar means.
as long as git doesn't build any shared libraries by itself and links to
them, this shouldn't be an issue.
