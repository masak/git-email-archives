You would need 'chmod +x git-test.git/hooks/post-update' here if
you are allowing people to pull over http from this repository.

I just realized that where this was documented was quite obscure
in the tutorial.  I'll update it with the appended patch.

The problem is that 'git clone' does not support cloning over
http from servers that are not properly prepared.  This 'git
clone' exited with non-zero status with an error message, didn't
it?

Mention post-update when we first talk about publishing a repository.

There is more detailed instruction for `project lead` later in
the tutorial to talk about the same, but at this point in the
flow of tutorial, the first time reader has no way of knowing it.
