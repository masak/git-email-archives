If you have only to run diff/patch, just use the native Win32 CreateProcess().
You abstract that on a git_exec(), and you use fork/exec on Unix and 
CreateProcess() on Winblows. If fork() is slow on Cygwin, fork+exec is 
pathetic. They do all that work to give you a fork(), and you throw it 
away with an exec().
