Dear diary, on Mon, Sep 19, 2005 at 06:06:21PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

It uses the name,room,blah,... format.

mutt:

  { "gecos_mask",       DT_RX,   R_NONE, UL &GecosMask, UL "^[^,]*" },

A regular expression used by mutt to parse the GECOS field of a password
entry when expanding the alias.  By default the regular expression is
set to "^[^,]*" which will return the string up to the first ","
encountered.  If the GECOS field contains a string like "lastname,
firstname" then you should set the gecos_mask=".*".
