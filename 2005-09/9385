Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 27, 2005 at 11:52:42AM CEST, I got a letter
where Josef Weidendorfer <Josef.Weidendorfer@gmx.de> told me that...

Yes. I'm actually inclined to keep this setup, simply because it is

  * easy
  * simple
  * sufficient in most of the cases

Cogito's fetch/update should certainly support the remotes stuff, since
they are obviously much more useful and practical for more complicated
setup, but I think I will keep the branches/ setup (the name of the
directory is the only thing I don't like on it ;) as the primary mean of
configuring remote branches.  I will only have to add possibility to
cg-fetch multiple branches at once, which could also make branches/
significantly more practical.

No. If you are in the branches/ playground, please keep it strictly
one-to-one mapping. That's what makes it easy and simple and that's what
makes it good.

Yes.

If ever doing that, this should be done at some other place than
branches/. And I'm sceptical about it anyway. Really, introducing some
new configuration mechanism just to tell Cogito what default branch name
should it pick up when you call fetch/update/merge without a parameter?
I don't know if that wouldn't make more evil than good.

Well, if you _really_ _really_ badly want it, we can make
.git/default-origin/ or something... duh, what a stupid name. :)
