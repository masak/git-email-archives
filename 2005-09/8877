The point is that our guess should be something which works for the most
people.

I'll change cg-commit to always include the name/email fields in its
template. I think it's verbose enough as it is now, though, and I don't
want it to bloat it with more generic help text. I've expanded the
documentation of cg-commit on the GIT_ variables and that ought to be
enough. :-)
