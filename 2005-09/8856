Yeah, I should have separated those two so that the GIT_DIR option
could be accepted on its own.  And it should maybe have a --git-dir=
log form as well.

The reason I did -e too was simply that I needed it for the same
reason I needed -d.  I wanted to run git with specific values for
GIT_DIR and EDITOR without having to setenv them in emacs.  But the
EDITOR trick I'm using is a hack and should be replaced anyway. (I use
EDITOR=cat to get access to the default commit message with comments
from 'git commit').

So please disregard the -e part of my patch for now.  You are free to
disregard the -d part as well, but I think that makes some kind of
sense.

And If we go down this path, maybe flags for other GIT_* environment
variables should be settable with git command line flags too?
