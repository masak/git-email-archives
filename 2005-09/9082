Using Cogito, we've found a couple of cases where merging on a dirty
tree messed things up. The local changes were lost after the merge.

I didn't bother to investigate further, because I didn't know whether
it was supported "formally", or meant to be supported for long.
Instead, I added a check in cg-merge that refuses to run on a dirty
tree.

I guess I'll take that out, and try and debug any future sightings of
the problem...
