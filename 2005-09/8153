One thing that comes to mind, which may or may not be relevant
to your situation, is which branch you were on when you ran
cg-update.  I cannot speak for Pasky and I do not use Cogito,
but the 'git fetch' and 'git pull' commands that come with core
GIT used to have a funny interaction of fetch attempting to
update the branch head ref if your working tree happened to be
on that branch, which was fixed some time ago.
