The really exciting thing to do would be to have different programs use 
different implementations, by way of linker magic.

My guess for the ideal is to have a linked list with a hashtable for 
finding entries by looking up names, because we don't look things up by 
index. This combination gives O(1) in-order iteration, O(1) lookup by 
name, O(1) append, O(n) insert, and O(1) remove. This means that 
git-update-cache --add would be slow, but everything else would be fast. 
(Except, of course, for the overhead of actually reading and writing the 
index file, rather than mmaping it.)

Another thing to try would be the original dynamic table implementation, 
plus a hashtable for name lookups, generated the first time a lookup is 
attempted (since some programs don't do any lookups by name). This has the 
advantage of skipping the O(n) startup.
