From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>

It uses $1 rather than ${ARGS[0]}, which breaks when optparse found some
options, i.e. with cg-admin-uncommit -t (cg-object-id -c -t is not nice).

Please, document optparse to explain this. It's absolutely non-obvious, and when
I first hit this I thought optparse was buggy but couldn't make my way to the
fix.

Both because I was using cogito rather than debugging it, and even considering
the obfuscation level, but above all I was looking for a call to shift in
optshift and didn't find it. Now I understood the thing I pity myself, though.

Btw, why doesn't optparse consume all the cmd arguments via shift, making thus
sure that $1 never works at all?
