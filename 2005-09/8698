Doing exactly that:

	gitk 08cf4121ad704faa5ae7c7ae7b3dca4476ef2770 \
		8493c04f1b8c9da0c5dc83091cabbcd0b98954ed \
		e1bcd2a5d53bceef2679737474487e32d87e7f2c \
		c1b779fbce762c970e3ace4332bb6ddc0de65e61

says that three of the commits were the same one, redone:

	Added support for mtddevnum and mtddevname variables.

in one form or another (quick look at the diffs says that one was 
apparently re-done because you forgot the changelog entry, I didn't look 
any closer).

So I suspect that's you just undoing a commit, and redoing it. I assume
that somewhere in the _reachable_ tree is one final commit that actually
did that, but I didn't bother to search for it (but that's easy too if you
want to:just go "gitk --all" and then search for that "Added support for
mtddevnum"...)

The fourth commit is 8493c

	Rebased: Rewrite of NAND code based on what is in 2.6.12 Linux kernel

and considering that you seem to have other undo's in the tree, I'll just
assume this is one more, but you would know.
