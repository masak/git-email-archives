I agree that would be nice.  If you are only interested in tags
that refer to commits that anchor points in published branches,
maybe we should have something along the lines of info/refs to
help the downloaders?  Perhaps info/refs showing the SHA1 id of
the non-tag object each tag dereferences to in addition to the
current output?

This is a bit hard and needs some thinking to do cleanly,
because what is in info/refs is what is sent from the publisher
side over git-native protocol at the beginning of the handshake,
and it is not easy to add that to git-native protocol cleanly
and backward-compatibly (I think I know how without breaking
existing clients, but it is not clean).
