Tags fetching. I agree that the difference isn't that big other than
this (contrary to the other fetchers, ssh-fetch won't reproduce the pack
setup; this may sound as a bad thing, but it prevents transfer of
redundant data which is pretty much inevitable (or for free) for the
other fetchers). And since we will probably move to the pack fetchers
for tags as well, I agree that there indeed is little point in this.
I will switch all the git+ssh fetching to it after I implement the new
tags fetching.

By the way, how much more CPU-intensive are the pack-based methods in
practice, especially on the server (packing) side? Could it be
noticeable?
