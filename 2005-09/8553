You need to find the correct location to insert in the sorted list, and 
the hash table won't help you, because it doesn't have the new name. 
Remember that the cursors need to go through the index in order, so the 
list has to stay sorted.

I've written a nice hash table which should work well, if you want to make 
the coding style suitable.

Oh, right, I forgot that the orgnaizational structure isn't the array of 
structs, but an array of pointers.
