I'm running git & cogito on OSX 10.3.9 (Panther) with fink
0.7.1(stable), and have been using git w/o problems. I've just done an
update and recompiled to confirm...

Not a problem on 10.3.9.

Not a problem on 10.3.9.

I _am_ seeing this problem, but it's definitely an issue with Tk. I'd
be thankful if you could post the fixes...

sudo cpan install File::Temp ?

At any rate, I've just checked and File::Temp is part of the Perl
5.8.1 installed in 10.3.9. Even fink knows this, and if you do
apt-cache show system-perl it'll tell you that it includes File::Temp.

Any platform-specific changes should be limited to backwards compat,
really. MacOSX is converging quickly towards GNU/Linux compatibility
in the build environment.

cheers,
