Since you will be saying "make CURLDIR=blah" anyway, I'd ask you
to say "make CURLDIR=blah CFLAGS='-O -g'" and will forget about
this part.

The rest of your patch I am keeping a variant based on it, done
slightly differently, in the proposed updates branch.  I'll have
it graduate to the master branch when I hear from somebody (can
be you) with SunPro that the it is OK (or an improvement patch).

Thanks.
