Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 20, 2005 at 04:07:28AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

When I'm active on the mailing list, you can be sure that I'd complain
if I didn't like it. ;-)

I think the start of October is fine for Cogito. Cogito users usually
upgrade both Cogito and GIT at once, it seems.

Cogito does not use any of those.

Well, if it should be kept, it should certainly be in sync with
git-diff-* tag letters. But Cogito uses only the diff tag letters and
I'm not sure if tag letters for all files in repository would really be
useful for anything.

Yes. I would complain loudly during the discussion, but I unwisely
skipped it at first and then didn't read the list for a few weeks.
My fault, I have to make the best way out of the terminology mess I'm
in now.
