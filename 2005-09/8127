Do you know if there's anything like case #16 in there? I'd be interested 
to know if there's anything that gets handled automatically in different 
ways depending on which single base is used, and doesn't require manual 
intervention with multiple bases, because that's probably wrong.

I didn't want to break the assumption of only one entry per stage in the 
initial version. I'm also not sure that listing the ancestors is 
particularly useful in this case. They have to be exactly the contents of 
stages 2 and 3, plus possibly more stuff that's not been kept by either 
side. What you actually want is a two-way merge (i.e., a diff between the 
two sides, presented in "merge" format), so you don't really need any 
ancestors, unless it would fit some more general case that way.

Great. Want me to send the patches with better organization, or are you 
set with what I've sent?
