You do realize that up until a week ago (six days, to be exact),
kernel.org was running git-0.99.4, which I don't think actually
implemented any of the info stuff?

So out of the 57 repositories, how many haven't been updated in a week?

I suspect that explains a large portion of it.

Also, I really do think that the dumb transports are oversold, and 
git-daemon is undersold. I know all about firewalls, but I also think that 
if people used the smart protocols more, that's a problem that would 
largely solve itself. 

Dumb protocols can never do really well. That's just very fundamental.
