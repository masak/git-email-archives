I recall somebody else had trouble when we say 'cd blah' in our
script and the CDPATH in the user's environment interfere and
took us elsewhere.

I do not have any problem with people who have CDPATH defined as
a plain shell variable (not exported) in their interactive
shells, but I really do not see a point of having CDPATH as an
environment variable, exported to be honored by any unsuspecting
shell scripts.

Until somebody convinces me that CDPATH in the environment is a
good idea, I do not have much sympathy to people with such an
environment.
