Is it possible that we could integrate the "diff" algorithm into git, and 
get rid of the dependency on an external GNU diff? It would also make the 
portability problems go away (ie old diff's being broken).

It would also potentially speed up the normal built-in diff a lot, since
we wouldn't have to execute a whole other program to generate a diff, just
call a helper function the way we do for xdiff..

Unreasonable?
