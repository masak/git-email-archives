Forget the cherry pick commands -- here's a usable, easy strategy.

git-checkout the "source" branch, create a temporary directory to hold
the patches, and call

    git-format-patch --mbox -o patchdir destbranch

This will create one file per patch in the destination directory. Feel
free to delete patches you don't want, and edit the patches you've got
there. Then switch to the destination branch, and use git-applymbox to
merge them in.

If you do this repeatedly, git-format-patch will not reexport patches
you've merged to the destination branch already (if they merged
cleanly unchanged)... or at least that's the theory ;)

The only limitation I've found in this strategy is that it doesn't
deal with binary objects. I'm lost as to what to do in those cases.

cheers,


martin
