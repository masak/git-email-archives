I did the above just after your announcement but before the tags etc had got 
there (see my earlier question in this thread).

I am rather new to all this, but this last step puzzles me.

Before this step, and using gitk --all, I can see the maintenance branch, but 
its currently connected to the point where the v0.99.7c tag is and not where 
your latest tag is.

So if I followed these instructions, now, wouldn't I just get the v0.997c tag?

Does that mean I have missed some step along the way to get the maint branch 
position moved to the new tag?
