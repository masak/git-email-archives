Having said that, I am sympathetic to what you are trying to do
here; if what I understand what you are trying to do matches
what you are actually trying to do, that is.

I think there should be a way to say "I do not care if this
repository does not have all the history back to root -- as long
as I can operate on reasonably recent commits, do not complain
about missing objects" to fsck-objects and various fetch
engines.  We can cauterize commit history chain using the grafts
file so that 'git log', 'git whatchanged', and 'gitk' would stop
somewhere.  Commit walkers can help you, albeit somewhat
differently, if you do not give -a flag to them.
