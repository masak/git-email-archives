Dear diary, on Sun, Aug 21, 2005 at 09:17:42AM CEST, I got a letter
where Johnny Stenback <jst@mozilla.org> told me that...
> Hi all,

Hello,

can you provide a concrete example of such a situation? This should
never ever happen - cg-update should refuse to touch any files
containing uncommitted changes.
