I'll let others comment on the need for this type of facility and it's 
proposed implementation.

Since you are proposing an API, some basic documentation about how to 
use the API would be nice. Comments in cache.h seems the best place, for 
now.

The sentence "This patch series is against the "proposed updates" 
branch, as of a couple of days ago." should have also included a commit 
ID. That way we would know where/when the patches would apply cleanly 
for testing and dissection.
