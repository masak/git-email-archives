Good. (Although that patch doesn't seem to be directly on top of my 
version; I can tell what it's doing anyway)

I'm happy with the content in "pu"; the issue is just whether you want the 
history cleaned up more. In the series I sent, I kept forgetting parts 
that belonged in earlier patches.

Could you look over the documentation in 
Documentation/technical/trivial-merge.txt, and see if it's a suitable 
replacement for the table in t1000-read-tree-m-3way.sh? It should be the 
same, except for ALT or non-ALT versions that we're not using, combining a 
few matching cases, describing the rules behind index requirements rather 
than listing outcomes, and the addition of info on how multiple ancestors 
are handled.
