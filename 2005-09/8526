It shouldn't resolve it at all if it's case #16; I'll have to check on 
that.

More precisely, case #16 only comes up when, in coming from the ancestors, 
one side decided to match one ancestor, and the other side decided to 
match the other; it is rarely the case that this could occur due to the 
two merges making opposite decisions to entirely ignore the other 
ancestor, and the only remaining case is that the merges each chose the 
same ancestor, and one side reverted to the other. So it's pretty certain 
that you've got a 50-50 chance of losing the correction.
