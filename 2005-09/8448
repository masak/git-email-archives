heh.  well, i had something like this earlier, but i know linus doesn't 
like void *, and it was really kind of ugly.  and as you observed, it's 
used so rarely.  so i just decided to drop it.

actually this is simple to add now.  i'll give it a shot (and fix up 
write_cache to use it).

btw, with daniel's changes i don't see where we're using 
active_cache_changed any more.
