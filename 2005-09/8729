I've got git mostly working on OpenBSD.  Here is what I changed:

diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile

The two issues showing up are
1) missing strcasestr() which is used in mailinfo.c
2) OpenBSD tar tvf doesn't format the date as we expect.

There were talks about making a directory compat/ with system 
specific code, where an implementation of strcasestr.c could go?

With those changes all I did to compile was: 

gmake CFLAGS+='-I/usr/local/include/ -L/usr/local/lib'
gmake test
gmake install
