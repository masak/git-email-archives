The new merge is totally unusable in real life.

I get 

	Need real merge but the working tree has local changes.

which is totally bogus. Sure, my working tree has local changes, but they 
have absolutely nothing to do with the stuff I merge. I almost _always_ 
keep local changes in my tree, and I worked hard to make sure that merging 
works well even despite that, and does the right thing.

Local changes are a problem ONLY IF THOSE LOCAL CHANGES INTERFERE WITH THE 
MERGE.

If the new merge policies do not allow that, then the new merge policies 
are incredibly broken. The old one did exactly the right thing for this 
case, and "git-read-tree -m" did

	Entry '%s' would be overwritten by merge. Cannot merge.

only if a file that actually needed merging was different.
