I don't have a porcelain, but I organize my working trees/repository in a 
non-standard way, using an additional script (which creates a new working 
tree linked to an existing repository). 

I've also got a set of scripts for splitting up a patch into a series, 
which I've still not gotten around to cleaning up and submitting.

For the way I structure my working trees, it would be really helpful if 
all of the miscellaneous things that should stay with a repository (such 
as remotes) were in a single subdirectory of .git, so that I could just 
have a third symlink and have it all work, rather than needing a bunch of 
additional links.
