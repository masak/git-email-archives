Dear diary, on Sun, Sep 25, 2005 at 09:22:14PM CEST, I got a letter
where Nico -telmich- Schottelius <nico-linux-git@schottelius.org> told me that...

This means someone probably pushed out some new stuff you don't have
yet (or you did something evil, like uncommitted something you already
pushed out before). So what to do is cg-update, that will merge the new
stuff, then try to cg-push again.

cg-push already spits out a somewhat more helpful message about this in
some cases, I'll make it do so in all cases. Thanks.
