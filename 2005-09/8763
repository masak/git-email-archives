  Hi,

  this is a mostly bugfix release of Cogito-0.14.2. It fixes several
minor bugs, one major bug (cg-rm not working in the directory), and adds
one new fix-feature - cg-push now works for any combination of
local/remote head names, not just for both being 'master'. Also,
cg-pushing from symlinked directory will trigger the remote update hook
properly.

  Note that this release deprecates .git/exclude. Please consider making
your list of exclude files revision controlled and global to the whole
project, not just your repository. If you are positive that you do not
want that, please move it to .git/info/exclude.

  Happy hacking,
