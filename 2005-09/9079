You know, I personally was unaware that this was supported until now.
I have been always reverting local debugging changes in order to merge
other people's work in, then reapply the debugging changes afterwards.

I guess I won't have to do that any more. :-)

So as long as they don't interfere, you can keep local debugging
changes out of GITs way for just about anything right?  For example,
as long as you don't "git-update-cache foo.c" those files in your
local debugging hack, you can just "git commit" afterwards and
only put in the changes you want.  It won't myseriously find those
modified files and what to do something with them right?

This goes with the idea that GIT only works with what you tell it
about, I suppose.
