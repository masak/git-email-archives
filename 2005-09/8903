Dear diary, on Mon, Sep 19, 2005 at 11:29:41PM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...
> Hello!

Hello,

do we really need --help in *-id? They are some kind of scripts
half-internal and half for the user - their _primary_ use is from the
other scripts, but they are standalone since they can be useful for the
end user as well in various situations. I can roughly remember cg-Xlib
inclusion in those scripts being significantly visible on the running
times of the users.

Thanks, this was already taken care of by Martin Atukunda.
