That commit shouldn't be dangling, but I suspect it is harmless and is
most likely because you have pack-files. Use "git-fsck-cache --full" if
you are downloading with http/rsync (since that gets packs without
unpacking them, and you haven't re-packed everything).

The git thing may be similar, although it sounds unlikely. A more likely
reason is that earlier http pulling got incomplete trees if you ever
interrupted it with ^C.

Yes, they can be worrisome. Some of it may be normal (I really suspect 
that the kernel tree is that kind - a "dangling commit" is almost always 
either because you've lost a tag or because of a pack-file that wasn't 
examined).

Your git tree is quote possibly corrupted.

The good news is that if "git checkout" works, then the corruption is all
old - you may not have all of the history, but the corruption is
"harmless".

There's nothing fundamentally wrong with not having all of history: it
will cause fsck to complain (unless you "plug" the history by using a
graft file). And obviously it means that you may not be able to go back in 
time - but you may never even care. 

A "git-http-fetch --recover HEAD <url>" _should_ fix it, but I don't think 
that works right now. It's documented, but it doesn't do anything. Junio?
