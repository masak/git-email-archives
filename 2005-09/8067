Grepping for what?

It is not /that/ much more expensive to run file(1) over the tree if you
want to know what is a script and what isn't. Furthermore, the "-script"
extension doesn't work for this as of today (see your own message a while
back ;-). Keeping it requires discipline that tools don't help enforcing
today (and the extension use itself is very un-Unix-like), so further
"mistakes" /will/ happen.

In any case, this would be for a very specialized, developer-only,
occasional task. I don't see how that warrants a fractured tool namespace
for /all/ users /all/ the time.
