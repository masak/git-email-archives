I think the only thing missing from the read-tree tests was for refusing 
to create directory/file conflicts which would otherwise be permitted when 
not using the --emu23 flag. Other than that, everything I neglected to 
handle caused something to fail. That reminds me that I still owe you a 
replacement test for this case.

I think I also owe you some tests for fetch. Any suggestions on writing 
unit tests? (I'd like to test that fetch.c actually calls functions in the 
right order and such, even in complicated cases)
