Dear diary, on Fri, Sep 23, 2005 at 11:16:42AM CEST, I got a letter
where Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com> told me that...

This is very unfortunate because the tutorial is now unavailable, and
for some reason it is not available in the StGIT distribution either.
Could you please bundle it?

Thanks,
