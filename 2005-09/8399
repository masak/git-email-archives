actually it might be best to have a list discussion first.  if i can 
answer questions and provide a few explanations here, the list archive 
might be a reasonable resting place for documentation.

the API is fairly simple and is documented via the function names. 
there isn't a whole lot of function-level documentation in the git code 
base that i have seen, so i erred on the side of less is more.

the first patch "introduce-cache-cursors provides most of the interface, 
and the subsequent patches demonstrate how to use it by changing parts 
of the git C code base to use the interface instead.

the main pieces are:

+  struct cache_cursor

which describes a position in the cache.

+  init_cc

which sets the given cursor to the top of the cache.

+  cc_to_ce

which extracts the cache entry that a cursor refers to.

+  next_cc, prev_cc, cache_eof

which allow cursor movement.

+  next_name

which skips to the next unique name in the cache.

+  walk_cache

which calls a function for each entry in the cache, in order.  the given 
function is responsible for moving the cursor to the next position 
before returning.

+  cache_find_name

which returns a cache cursor pointing to the found entry or to the entry 
which can be used as an insertion point if nothing matches.

+  cache_find_entry

which is a wrapper around cache_find_name that returns an entry instead 
of a position.

i'm a dork.

i will include the base ref in my future postings.
