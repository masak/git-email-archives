It's actually just the core loop of rev-list's original behavior. It's 
equivalent to putting the commit we're looking for in the list and popping 
the list until it comes back out, except that it saves a bit of 
list-fiddling. It's worth knowing that you can do rev-list (minus some of 
the features for human-readability) integrated into your program with just 
a couple of lines.
