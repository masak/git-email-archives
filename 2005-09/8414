I agree that it only works for the current conversion, due to there only 
being a limited amount you might try to do in a single git executable 
currently. Long-term, that should be fixed.

Wouldn't it be better to only take it in cc_init(), and have the cursor 
remember what it's iterating through?

I'm actually particularly interested in having a pair of caches for 
read-tree, because it would actually like to keep the old index separate 
from the index it's building.
