Why don't you commit the debugging changes, go back one step in the
tree (reverting them through git in practice), merge other's people
work then merge the debugging changes back in ?  You never know when
the debug changes will be useful again, so it's nice to have them in
your private tree, and this method makes it reasonably automatic.
