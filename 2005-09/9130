And you get an extra file, pax_global_header, containing the commit ID
of the archive's contents.

This happens when you have pathes inside the tar file that are longer
than 100 characters.  Is this taken from a real-world project or is it
just some test?

All your files with pathes longer than 100 chars will be extracted as
<SHA1>.data, with an accompanying <SHA1>.paxheader file.  The latter
contains the real filename.  You could then repair the mess by renaming
them manually or write a script that does it for you.  Or you could
simply update tar. :-)

Lately I noticed that the tar version used by the BSDs also doesn't
understand Pax extended headers.  I guess they're not that popular a
feature.

Nothing has changed in this respect, basicly since git-tar-tree went in.
