No. "oldhead" has to be the point where you did the last email thing.

So any time you merge from me, next time your email cron-job (or whatever)  
hits, ^linus _will_ make a difference. Without it, you'd email out all the 
stuff that came through my tree.

Good man.

Ehh. This is getting ugly, but hey, that's my middle name.

	git-rev-list --header newhead ^oldhead |
		grep -z "committer .*tony\.luck" |
		tr '\0' '\n' |
		git-shortlog


and btw, this depends on "git-shortlog" also understanding non-pretty log 
messages, with a patch like below.

Junio?

		Linus "ugly" Torvalds

Subject: Teach git-shortlog about raw log format too

This teaches "git-shortlog" to understand the non-prettified author format 
too, so you can use it with "--pretty=raw" or "--header" output too.
