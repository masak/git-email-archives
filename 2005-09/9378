Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 27, 2005 at 12:03:47AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

By the way, this is how Cogito did merging for some (rather short) time
period (actually, there's perhaps still some remnant of this, I think
Cogito still by default ignores ,,merge* which was the subdirectory
where the merge happenned). I removed it because IIRC the people weren't
eventually all that excited about it after all and Linus changed his
mind too.
