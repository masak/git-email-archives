To recap, you did:

    (before 0.99.7d propagated to the mirrors)
    $ git clone http://kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git git-src
    $ cd git-src

    (after 0.99.7d propagated to the mirrors)
    $ git fetch origin tag v0.99.7d
    $ git checkout -f maint

The 'fetch origin tag v0.99.7d' step should have left
the new file .git/refs/tags/v0.99.7d _after_ downloading all the
objects necessary to reconstruct the history to get there.  

Ah, you are right.  My instruction did not update other branches
for you.  My bad.

Assuming people stay on their "master" branch, and have the
recommended .git/remotes/origin contents in my previous message,
then the steps "after 0.99.7d propagated to the mirrors" would
just be:

    $ git fetch

which would fetch all the branches mentioned in the remotes
file, and then:

    $ git checkout -f maint

which would switch your working tree to maint branch.

NOTE NOTE NOTE.  The above assumes you are on your "master"
branch when you run 'git fetch' --- if you are on any of the
branches that is being updated (you can check which branch you
are on with 'git branch' without argument, or just with 'ls -l
.git/HEAD') 'git fetch' will complain because doing so without
updating them to match the updated branch head would make your
index file and working tree inconsistent with your .git/HEAD,
but 'git fetch' is supposed to be only fetching without touching
the working tree.
