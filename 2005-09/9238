Thanks.  Next time, please format your patch according to
Documentation/SubmittingPatches.  Your MUA ate tabs and leading
whitespaces from the diff, and you lack Signed-off-by line.

I think you need to pass down SHELL_PATH, and prepare for people
running 'make' by hand in t/ directory.

BTW, do you have access to a Linux machine to play with?  It
would have caught this fairly easily.

Test of 'tar' timestamp would also fail if you do not use
'gtar', but as far as I know that test is the only place we
really rely on 'tar', so it may not be worth fixing.

'xargs -0' and 'find -print0' is really essential in some of the
git barebone scripts.  I think the one in git-reset can go, by 
unlinking in the Perl script instead of printing the name and
running "xargs -0 rm -f --" on it.

The one in git-commit I am not sure about.  We do want to make
it really generic and keep allowing LF in paths.  Maybe we would
want 'git-update-index --stdin [-z]' to read list of paths from
the standard input.

The one in git-grep I would not worry too much about; we should
rewrite the whole thing in Perl and the problem will disappear.
