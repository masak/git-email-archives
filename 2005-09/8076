Various messages have already described this series. There's still a 
memory leak that should get resolved, but otherwise it should work. I'm 
not entirely sure that all directory-file conflict cases are handled 
properly, and some undefined cases behave differently. Also, I was a bit 
careless with preparing the patches.
