Hmph.  One reason the original implementation did not do this is
because Linus and other people wanted to have a repeatability,
so making this an optional thing is good, but if we go this
route, I think if it would be nicer to have a --author-map
option that lets you feed a list of:

    <author> ==> "A U Thor <author@author.dom>"

mappings, instead of a single -e, which essentially does not add
much information to the result.

I take that your oob comment indicates that you do not have much
incentive/inclination to further hack on this, so I am not
asking you to do the above even if you find my suggestion
worthwhile.
