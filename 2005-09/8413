Note that the simplest way to do this is to try to use "git-rev-list" as 
much as possible. The "--parents" flag makes the output have the parents 
(automatically _including_ any grafts) on the line that contains the 
commit ID.

That's especially true of any tools that use git-rev-list anyway for other
reasons. Eg "gitk" could parse the parent stuff this way, and didn't need
to know about the info/grafts file at all. I suspect the same should be
true of gitweb.

(So instead of trying to parse the parent info from the header of the 
commit, just do "git-rev-list --pretty --parents" and parse that).
