I've always multi-tasked, but when I started git I was ready to drop it. 
Then I came up with that wonderful "merge in the index" approach, and I 
could do it again, and I was _soo_ happy.

I often have local changes in my tree that I don't want to commit but that 
I'm testing out. Havign them interfere with merging other peoples work 
would mean that I'd have to have a totally separate tree for that, which I 
could do, but I'm much much happier not having to.
