It hopefully shouldn't happen any more with the improved and fixed

I suspect rmk is using cogito-0.13, and that it still has the older 
git-merge-base that can get confused by the date-ordering problem. And 
when git-merge-base gives the wrong result (not either of the commit 
objects it was given as an argument), then "git resolve" will do the wrong 
thing.

I just checked, and the _current_ git-merge-base definitely gives the 
right result:

	linux$ git-merge-base -a \
		6b39374a27eb4be7e9d82145ae270ba02ea90dc8 \
		194d0710e1a7fe92dcf860ddd31fded8c3103b7a

results in

	194d0710e1a7fe92dcf860ddd31fded8c3103b7a

ie it correctly notices that the second commit is the parent of the first
one.

Well, that would depend on having the fixed git-merge-base in the first 
place, which in turn would mean that such a commit wouldn't happen at all, 
so it's kind of circular. It's not worth fixing anywhere else, since once 
you fix it in git-merge-base, it just becomes a non-issue.

Hopefully we'll have a new cogito release soon, and this particular bug
will be a thing of the past.
