I think when it comes to simplicity it would be better to have 
something that would filter all of the changes on a branch
by pathname and create a branch against the original project
with just those changes.

Then we can do the noop merge of that branch into the larger
project, and we can merge that branch into the original project.

The nice part of doing it after the fact by just filtering changes
is you don't have to plan ahead to handle that case, which
should be a lot easier to handle.

The set of pathnames to filter could be easily stored in the .git
metadata so doing repeatedly is straight forward.
