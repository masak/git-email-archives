ok, i've done this.  read_cache_unmerged now reads into a separate 
cache, and read-tree.c does the merge by moving the appropriate cache 
entries into the active cache.

the linked list prototype is done, and works correctly.  this validates 
the new cache cursor API.  unfortunately because finding a name is now 
O(n), many things are slower than before (but i expected this would be 
the case for lists).

the next step is to try out more sophisticated data types.  we have 
three on the table so far:

1.  linus' sparse hyperlist implementation.  i suspect this will have 
the same bad performance characteristics as a standard linked list.

2.  self-balancing trees.  a splay tree is a good example.  we can 
reduce the size of the tree by storing all stages of a name in each 
node.  kernel source is about 18K files, which means we can find names 
in about 15 steps, on average.

3.  hash table, hashing on ce->name.  similar to a Python dictionary. 
with an 8 kilobucket hash table and a good hash function, we can store 
the kernel source, finding names in two or three steps on average.

are there others?
