With help from various people, 0.99.7a is out to fix
showstoppers, brown paper bags, and obviously safe
improvements.

 - For distributions that do not have Python 2.4 yet, we stop
   requiring it.  Instead, we ship our own copy of "subprocess"
   module with blessings of Peter Astrand, the author, as a
   fallback.  Many thanks to HPA for suggesting the directions
   on this issue.

 - A long-standing bug in git-init-db that creates a bogus empty
   directory while copying templates has been found and fixed,
   thanks to Pasky and HPA.

 - Linus fixed short SHA1 name completion -- this is not a
   strict showstopper bugfix but deemed safe enough.

 - git-show-branch, when run in a corrupt repository, segfaulted
   instead of complaining.

 - 0.99.7 created compatibility symlinks for commands that are
   not available in that installation/configuration.  Thanks to
   Patrick Mauritz this is now fixed.

 - Platforms that lack strcasestr() could not use mailinfo;
   Linus wrote 'a stupid replacement', which was further fixed
   by Joachim B Haga.  This is not a showstopper but even if
   this replacement were buggy the platforms that could not
   compile git for the lack of it would not be in worse shape
   anyway, so this is included here.

 - Needlessly insulting error message in git checkout was backed
   out.  Sorry about that.
