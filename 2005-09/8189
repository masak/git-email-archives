sorry, of course you're right..

the #ifndef __sun was done because getdomainname() doesn't exist on
solaris. (just for clarification)

hmm.. no idea why it worked for me, but a test case fails now: better
make that -L -R -l

because on solaris there are lots of places where external libraries
could be found (/usr/local/lib, /opt/csw/lib, whereever people who
package themselves put them). ld.so.conf doesn't exist (same as on
*bsd), so using -L and -R is the standard way of linking external
libraries.
