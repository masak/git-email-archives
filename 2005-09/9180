  Hello,

  I'm announcing the release of 0.15.1 of Cogito, the human-friendly UI
for Linus' GIT. You can find it at

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/

when kernel.org mirroring will go through another short period of
actually working. ;-)

  I'm cc'ing the Linux Kernel mailing list since this release contains
a bugfix for an ugly potential data loss bug, which actually probably
covers nearly all Cogito users (it was introduced in cogito-0.11.2).
If you had some local uncommitted changes and merge new stuff (either
using cg-update or cg-merge), in some cases it would silently trash your
local changes. It was caused by a bogus git-checkout-cache invocation
pointed out by Linus.

  Other interesting stuff:

  * cg-clean -d would remove the arch/ and include/ subdirs in Linux
    kernel - just any directories containing only subdirectories
    (this isn't as horrible as it sounds since you didn't lose anything
    precious you didn't want to lose - you can recover by just doing
    cg-restore)
  * Support for fetching from URLs of the 'git' protocol scheme
  * cg-log -d filters based on date
  * cg-diff works on BSD now
  * Merge cg-(commit|parent|tree)-id to cg-object-id
  * Some significant documentation enhancements
  * Some new tests in the testsuite (for cg-merge ;-)
  * Usual squad of minor bugfixes

  Happy hacking,

--
