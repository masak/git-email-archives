Since I have my pine installed in git, I could git grep it. It says

    /* full name is all chars up to first ',' (or whole gcos, if no ',') */
    /* replace any & with logname in upper case */

I don't know why the & rule, but there you have it..

The Perl User::pwent module seems to agree, btw (also about '&'):

   "Interpretation of the gecos field varies between systems, but
    traditionally holds 4 comma-separated fields containing the user's
    full name, office location, work phone number, and home phone number.  

    An & in the gecos field should be replaced by the user's properly
    capitalized login name."

I still worry about names of the type "Torvalds, Linus", but maybe that's 
just not an issue.
