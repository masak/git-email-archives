Oh, ok. Then, do something like this:

	mv .git/objects/pack .git/objects/old-packs
	mkdir .git/objects/pack
	for i in .git/objects/old-packs/*.pack
	do
		echo $i:
		git-unpack-objects < $i
	done

and it will do the right thing. Doing the right thing means, among other 
things, that if an object already exists in an alternate object directory, 
it won't be written to disk again.

(So if you have an "alternates" file pointing to my objects, and your 
packs contain mainly/only objects that I've pulled, basically nothing will 
actually be unpacked.)

After that, do a git-fsck-cache to make sure everything looks good, and 
just "rm -rf .git/objects/old-packs".

And yes, we could make something like this a helper script.

NOTE! During the unpacking, the repository may not be usable, so make sure 
that nobody else tries to access it while you do this.
