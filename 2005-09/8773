Yes - I had increasingly believed that with all the scripts being generated 
with git that cogito was becoming irrelevant.  However experience of the last 
day has shown me that is far from the case.

I really like cg-commit where it lists the files its going to commit for you, 
and where if you delete the line it doesn't.  If I've been doing a bit too 
many things at once it helps commit in small chunks

Seems cogito branch handling only really deals with linking to others. I have 
ended up also using git branch and git checkout -f to keep lots of little 
local branches in my repository.

Still struggling with how to cherry pick parts a previous update (between 
possibly two other branches) and apply them to a current branch - all the 
tutorials assume you want it all, and I can't really understand what the 
cherry pick commands do from their manuals.
