The first one agrees with what was actually committed. For the second
one the difference between the tree produced by the algorithm and what
was committed is:

diff --git a/include/net/ieee80211.h b/include/net/ieee80211.h
--- a/include/net/ieee80211.h

I have looked at the files and common ancestors involved and I think
that this change have been introduced manually. I may have missed
something when I analysed it though...

Len's merge case come out identically to the tree he committed. I have
described what I got for Tony's case in
<20050826184731.GA13629@c165.ib.student.liu.se> (my merge algorithm
produces the result Tony expected to get, but he didn't get that from
git-resolve-script).
