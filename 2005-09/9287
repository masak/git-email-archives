Checking in the change from "wish" to "wish8.4" was a mistake - that
was a change I made for some tests, and I forgot to change it back.
However, gitk does need tk 8.4 or later, since it uses the panedwindow
widget, which tk 8.3 doesn't have.  I have tk8.5a2 installed here,
which is nice because it does antialiased fonts, although it is a bit
slower (clock format is much slower because they changed it from being
implemented in C to Tcl).

No, it isn't intended, thanks for pointing that out.

Regards,
Paul.
