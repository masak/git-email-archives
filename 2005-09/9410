Here is what I think.  Multiple transfers at the same time, if
it becomes problem in pratcice, should be prevented at the upper
layer anyway, so this "interesting" problem is a moot point.  So
I'd say let's not worry about that.

Doing partial transfer support for packs and indices would be
more useful addition to your code than dealing with the above --
packs are much bigger than individual objects and would get much
bigger benefit from restartable download.

Different compressed representation is just a theoretical
curiosity and we do not know if it is a problem in practice.  As
long as you can detect the situation and die, it would be OK, I
think.
