  Hello,

  I've realized today that I "forgot" to rename cg-push to cg-upload, so
I impulsively did so right away, but now I'm seeing that the core git
still has git-push and no git-upload. This is confusing and appears to
be quite inconsistent - push should be the opposite of pull, but pull is
defined as fetch+merge, while push does just the anti-fetch ("upload")
part. Yes, it does the subset protection, but git-fetch with remotes/
seems to by default do the superset protection as well.

  How should we call it, then?
