Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 20, 2005 at 02:55:08AM CEST, I got a letter

Yes, but I'm just arguing about the naming - if you just take the word
"pull", "push" is the obvious opposite to that and vice versa, so if we
are going to use words "pull" and "push" in the same context, this
relation should be preserved. So "push" really _should_ mean

	ssh other-end 'git-pull'

whether it's a safe operation or not - if not, then GIT should have
nothing called "push". But the current "push" is really an opposite of
"fetch", so it should be called "upload", I believe.
