Dear diary, on Mon, Sep 26, 2005 at 01:46:13AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

I don't like that, the notion that you are fetching different stuff that
you are merging then seems quite confusing to me. But fetching just the
first revision will be confusing too. Either way, git-pull won't be
equivalent to git-fetch && git-merge (or git-resolve or whatever is the
core porcelain command) anymore. Well, the remotes stuff never got close
to my heart.

One alternative I can think of is, in case there are multiple heads,
require the user to explicitly specify the head he wants (origin#maint).
This comes from the idea that multi-head remotes are there really
primarily for fetching, not for pulling. There is also no potential for
confusion. In addition, there might another line "Default" in the remote
file, which could specify the default choice. It's just that choosing
the first one implicitly makes me a bit nervous and has potential for
bad mistakes. At least for Cogito, I would be reluctant to use it.

git-pull --merge-all or something to still do the octopus merge might be
useful in some cases (or as well might not - perhaps the best strategy
is to let whoever cares make a patch ;).
