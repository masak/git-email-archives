It is git-merge-recursive which wants Python 2.4. Unfortunately Python
2.3 do not ship with the 'subprocess' module which is currently used
by the 'recursive' merge strategy. RPMs for Python 2.4 can be
downloaded from http://www.python.org/2.4.1/rpms.html

Python isn't used by the rest of Git so if you don't use the recursive
merge strategy it will work fine without Python.

Not supporting one of the major Linux distributions isn't ideal
though, so maybe we should do something about this. I will have a look
at rewriting the code to not use subprocess.
