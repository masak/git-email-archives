Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 20, 2005 at 06:12:35AM CEST, I got a letter
where Brian Gerst <bgerst@didntduck.org> told me that...

Actually, I think most of it is unnecessary - it was around from very
early days, some of it from even before the time when we started
recording adds/removed in the cache. It just doesn't break anything so I
kept it around just to be sure, but I'll remove it soon - I want to
write some cg-commit regression tests first.
