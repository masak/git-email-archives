Well, the thing is, a true exporter probably doesn't want to use patches 
at all.

A truly good exporter would likely use

	git-diff-tree -M -r

or something to generate the list of filenames and versions, and then work 
on that. You really _have_ to, in order to get things like binary files 
right.

Anything that is based on diffs would suck.

Also, I suspect that to get the list of commits to export, a real exporter
is likely to first just do something like

	git-rev-list --parents --topo-order prev..

and generate the commit topology from there. Then just either use the C
library interfaces to suck in the commit messages, or just use
git-cat-file. And then git-diff-tree -M (or perhaps -C, if the
repo-to-be-exported-to knows about copies) to actually generate the 
revision info.

I think they can all go. I think some old scripts migth still use 
git-rev-tree, but it really is clearly inferior in every way to 
git-rev-list that such scripts should be fixed anyway. Fixing them should 
be pretty easy.

(The packed format actually makes git-rev-tree at least ok from a 
performance angle, even if it has to walk all the way to the root. But I 
_seriously_ doube you want to use it on any big repo anyway, and 
definitely not with an unpacked one).
