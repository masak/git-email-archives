  Hello,

  I'd like to hear the opinion of Cogito users about renaming the Cogito
commands accordingly to the GIT big renames. This would be:

	cg-pull -> cg-fetch
	cg-update -> cg-pull

  The pros: Terminological consistency with GIT. Some also might perceive
this naming like clearer (I don't, but that's probably the matter of
your environment of origin and opinion).

  The cons: Breaking backwards compatibility and confusing users. The
situation is more vexing since 'cg-pull' would change its meaning from
fetching to fetching+merging. So that alone would require four-phased
renaming (cg-fetch alias, removing cg-pull, wait long time, cg-pull
alias, removing cg-update).

  I'm actually rather opposed to the change. Cogito is getting
established, real-world projects and a lot of people in general already
use it, and this would break the finger habits for all of them, etc.
What do you think?
