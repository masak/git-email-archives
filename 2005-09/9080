Absolutely. 

It will happily merge a dirty tree, as long as none of the dirty files 
were modified.

And by "dirty" I mean "index matches HEAD, but contents do not match 
index".

It's very convenient. I usually have my local Makefile updated for the
next version for a few days before actually committing it, and I tend to
have any experimental patches that I sent out to people uncommitted in my
tree too, just to remind me and to test them.

That's correct. Also, since this is how I work, I've tried to make sure 
that the tools I work with are "safe". For example, git-applymbox will 
happily apply patches to a dirty tree, because it uses "git-apply --index" 
that refuses to apply a patch to a file that is modified. 

So it's perfectly safe to merge somebody elses _patch_ too - even with a
tree with patches. But git-applymbox will refuse to apply patches on a
tree where your index doesn't match the HEAD commit. So it's safe to have
a _dirty_ tree, but if you've done an "update-cache" and have an index
that doesn't match the parent any more, git-applymbox will refuse to run.

(Btw, that's something that I haven't checked whether I verified properly
in git-read-tree.. I basically never have my index out of sync with my
HEAD, but I should probably verify).
