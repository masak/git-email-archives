Some bash installs only install in /bin/sh, so..

Hey, the code isn't a mess. The fact that there are tons of different 
shells and they don't support it is the mess.

So we should strive for bash syntax to be so common that other shells 
follow suit ;)

I personally find perl to be a really bad language. It has more of a 
unified base (different versions, but at least not totally different and 
unrelated implementations), and it's clearly more powerful, but as a 
_language_ I don't understand how anybody can accept that crap.

The "there's more than one way to do something" slogan may be cute and
sound good to people who are drawn to that thing, but it's actually bad.  
The language is designed to be write-only, and the "you can do it fifty
different ways" is part of it (and line noise characters is another part
of it).

So sh is actually often a much better language. Too bad some of the 
features end up being outside the standard language.

I know, I know, people will consider me crazy for saying that. 

Oh, well. As long as all the _important_ stuff is in C, we're ok.
