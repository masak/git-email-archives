Well, what I wanted to see was if we can get away without
introducing more sophisticated data structures, which would add
complexity.

Yes, the reading of three trees upfront is probably the culprit
in your case, and I think that is something Daniel's read-tree
rewrite can help.  I still see some remove_cache_entry_at()
there because it works on the active_cache in place, but the
structure of the new code should be much easier to make the kind
of modification we are talking about.

If you already have a local copy of git.git repository you work in:

	git fetch http://kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git +pu:refs/heads/ko-pu
        git checkout -f ko-pu

Otherwise

	git clone http://kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git peek
        cd peek
        git checkout -f pu

The interesting change from the mainline is in read-tree.c

You can browse http://kernel.org/git/ and see commitdiffs in the
"pu" branch if you are not interested in slurping the whole
proposed updates branch.
