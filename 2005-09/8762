This is a somewhat special situation, because we're assuming that the 
packs are a complete set. When git-http-fetch downloads a pack, it still 
needs to know if that pack uses other stuff, in which case it probably 
needs to download it. The old code actually wouldn't have worked properly 
if the first pack didn't include any blobs that were still in the latest 
version, because it wouldn't track commits through the pack and only 
generally worked with multiple packs because it would need blobs from 
every pack to produce the current tree. 

I think that this gets particularly tricky with alternates, where the 
necessary packs for ancient history may not actually be in the list of 
packs in the repository we're looking at.
