Couldn't it also happen if there's stale data in MERGE_HEAD when you 
commit a normal patch? The description doesn't look like a merge at all, 
but rather like a normal patch that inappropriately picked up an extra 
head. I'd guess he tried to merge something, got a conflict, decided that 
he didn't really want to do that anyway, switched to a different branch, 
applied a patch, and committed without noticing the note that he seemed to 
be committing a merge.

Probably the right thing is actually to clean up more when switching 
tasks, but it would probably also be worth checking that merges make sense 
as well.
