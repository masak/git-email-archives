Also see my mail regarding cygwin:

This is the IPv6 stuff. There are patches to cygwin to support IPv6 
somewhere, but they haven't made it into mainline.

As for the other problem I mentioned in my original mail:

It seems that the fixup of the mmap()ed regions after a fork() does not 
work properly in cygwin. Remember that cygwin just wraps the non-POSIX 
Win32API and tries to make it sort of POSIX compliant. The problem is that 
Win32API lacks a proper fork(). This is therefore emulated, and after 
that, all the mmap()ed regions have to be mapped again. That fails.

Sidenote: I ran it inside gdb, and it worked fine! So I tried to recompile 
the cygwin1.dll, but that wrecked my whole installation of cygwin and I 
spent 2 hours just to be able to "gcc -o" again.

Ciao,
Dscho
