It does seem to be sending out a confusing message to us users too, 
since an initial clone of Linus's tree with rsync is on my machine 10x 
faster than an http clone, so it seems to be sending out something of a 
confused/confusing message re: rsync.

Am I right in thinking it's because rsync didn't originally have pack 
support, but now it does, Petr has simply forgotten to deprecate the 
deprecation message?

Kind Regards,

Martin
