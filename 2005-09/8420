Everthing that walk from one commit to another, uses git-rev-list, sure.
But in the commit view, and the commitdiff the "parent" link and the parent
that is passed to diff is read from the commit itself.

I need only one parent:
  git-rev-list --parents --max-count=1 <id>

Hmm, it's one more exec, but I don't need to look at the grafts file or
whatever will make it into git the next time I will look at it. :)

Kay
