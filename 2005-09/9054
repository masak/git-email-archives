All right, now I agree that "upload" isn't that appropriate, since
git-ssh-upload isn't actually for any push-related activity, even though
it is a git-ssh-fetch counterpart - it is so in a different sense.

I don't want to name it cg-send because I think that would be way too
easily confused with sending patches over e-mail. So it ended up being
cg-push again. :-)
