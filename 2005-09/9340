Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 27, 2005 at 12:23:41AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Yes - so you can't save the tag objects either, but then you'll re-slurp
them again and again, which is kind of silly. Alternatively, you could
actually make git-fsck-object silent about the case when an unreachable
(not referenced in refs/) tag object references a non-existing object -
perhaps unless --strict is passed to it. If you think the rest of my
logic is ok, I think this change to facilitate this "tags caching" is
not unreasonable.

The alternative solution would be to have the tags cache with the tag
objects separate of the main object database, but that'd be very dirty.
