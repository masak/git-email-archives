read-tree doesn't care about the relationships between its inputs; it's 
only interested in the trees. But using ancestors which aren't common is 
unlikely to give you desired results. I think, if you do read-tree a^ b^ a 
b, you will get everything into the index, but it'll all going to be 
conflicts.

I assume that what you want is something to include everything from two 
commits, which would give conflicts if a name is reused?
