Dear diary, on Mon, Sep 19, 2005 at 12:24:45PM CEST, I got a letter
where sf <sf@b-i-t.de> told me that...

Yes, but why should this matter? It shouldn't matter if you get the old
"version" or the new version of the file over HTTP, the actual object's
contents is still the same, and GIT shouldn't care.
