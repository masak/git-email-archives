Dear diary, on Thu, Sep 22, 2005 at 11:58:32AM CEST, I got a letter
where Robert Watson <robert.oo.watson@gmail.com> told me that...
> Hi,

Hi,

> I am wondering what is the best way to show the change introduced by a
> commit. In the other words, is there a better way to do this:
> 
> git-diff b163512d4eb36ee946908b682c7863658c5a8db4^
> b163512d4eb36ee946908b682c7863658c5a8db4

with Cogito, you would say

	cg-diff -p -r b163512d4eb36ee946908b682c7863658c5a8db4

to see the diff against its parent. (You should still choose the parent
manually in case of merge commits.)
