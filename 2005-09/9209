It is sure worth to try to be as portable as possible. Just look at the 
bugs found by running git on x86_64 (for example by HPA), which were not 
apparent from x86 or PowerPC.

Whoa, slow! The shell scripts and the networking are important parts even 
of the core git suite. Without them, work is next to impossible.

No. It means that there is something weird going on inside cygwin1.dll. 
This library works perfectly when the program is run inside gdb. Which 
could well mean some timing issue. Unfortunately, I have problems 
rebuilding cygwin1.dll, and therefore cannot debug in detail.

BTW I am fairly convinced that the same issues would trouble a git-pull, 
once the networking is running, since the pack transfer relies on 
fork()ing.

It sure would be nice to have a unified diff generator included, but I 
doubt that a reliable (=simple) one is easy to come by.
