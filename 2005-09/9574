I see sparse is already moving in this direction.  Right now, it's somewhere in
the middle, which is quite inconvenient.  It hardcodes gcc version numbers but
not the architecture.

I guess that's what cgcc is trying to be.  Since it also runs the compiler, no
special support for cgcc should be needed in Makefile other than using $(CC).
