GCC is not complaining.  :-)

My current make command is like this:

gmake NO_STRCASESTR=YesPlease CURLDIR=/opt/sfw/  \
      SHELL_PATH=/bin/bash INSTALL=ginstall install

There are two problems:

* First of all there really needs to be a TAR variable, 
  since Solaris tar doesn't like the C option. 

* Secondly I've noticed that git.sh and gitk don't get 
  their /bin/sh line changed during install.
