using a list was an easy prototype to see what issues there are when 
converting from an array into an abstract data type.  i've created a few 
helpers that allow me to limit the list implementation changes to 
cache.h, read-cache.c, and read-tree.c; but having these helpers means 
it should be fairly simple to switch to any reasonable data structure. 
(the helper parts are already working and i can post them to the list if 
folks are interested).

once the list implementation is working well, i plan to go back and 
replace it with something more sophisticated which can perform 
insertion, deletion, and searching efficiently.

in the long run, i see using a balanced tree.  that would make 
insertions and searches quick, and prevent the tree from degenerating 
into a linked list due to a series of in-order insertions.  a splay tree 
might be even more entertaining, as it always remains balanced, and a 
search operation places the found node or insertion point right at the 
root of the tree.

each node in the tree would represent a unique path, and have references 
to the entries of all four stages, contained in an array.  that would 
simplify several routines in read-cache.c and probably make the merge 
logic even easier to understand and more efficient.

the merge actually replaces entries in place, so it is already fairly 
efficient.  the wastage in the merge case arises from the many list 
insertions done by read_cache, all of which involve moving some of the 
active cache array.

i can already tell you that using a separate source and destination data 
structure during the merge simplifies the logic and makes it easier to 
understand.  i imagine it will also be easier to maintain and enhance in 
the long run.

as i'm new to git development, i wasn't aware of the proposed branch.  i 
will see if i can take a look (or send me a pointer to the list archives 
if he has posted them here).

i wanted to assess whether this was a reasonable idea or if there was 
already work in progress in this area.  thanks for your response!
