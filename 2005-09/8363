Hmmm - git-format-patch is now broken. Not sure if it's been this
particular commit or a change in git-rev-list. The bottom line is that
it will only create patches for my commits since the last merge.

This is broken when I work for a few days, merging often from my
upstream. At the end of the dev cycle, I want to generate the
patchbomb for upstream, and it only gives me the commits since the
last merge-in of upstream.

OTOH, git-log-script is doing the same since I've updated today.
Yesterday, both commands were behaving themselves...

cheers,

martin
