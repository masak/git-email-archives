git-clone -l -s does optimization similar to that in spirit, but
it does not create a repository with symlinked .git/object
pointing at /some/where/original/repo/.git/object.  Instead it
uses alternates to borrow from the other; newly created objects
are always stored locally.

But I thought you were talking about fetch.  git-fetch should be
able to pull into a repository whose .git/object happens to be a
symlink pointing at somewhere else just fine.

Both git-aware protocol and commit walker peek at the remote ref
and stop without downloading objects if it is known to us, so I
think we are OK.

Of course, the above 'git fetch' only fetches remote HEAD and
stores it in .git/FETCH_HEAD; if you truly want to 'clone', you
could first run git-ls-remote to peek the remote refs and then
give them as storing refspecs to git fetch, doing something like
this (modulo renaming 'master' over there to 'origin' here):

	mkdir foo && cd foo && git-init-db
	refspec=$(git-ls-remote $repo | \
	        sed -n -e 's/^[0-9a-f]*	//' -e 's|refs/.*|&:&|p')
	git fetch $repo $refspec
