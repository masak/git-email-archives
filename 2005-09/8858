Petr,

Your view of GECOS field contents (formatting) does not match my 
experience. Many organizations, both large and small, have standards and 
requirements for the contents and formatting of information in the GECOS 
field. Saying that the user's name is first and a particular punctuation 
character SHALL be the standard cut point and everyone not happy with 
the results should explicitly set the Git environment variables is the 
wrong approach.

A better approach is to not use the GECOS field contents at all and 
force everyone the set the Git environment variables, AND/OR to include 
the what Git thinks the user's name name might be in the commit message 
template they're editing (like the file list).
