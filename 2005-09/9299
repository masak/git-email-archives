Dear diary, on Mon, Sep 26, 2005 at 04:41:54PM CEST, I got a letter
where Brian Gerst <bgerst@didntduck.org> told me that...

That should be fixed then, so that we fully utilize the network.

Is that really the case? I believe it will walk only to the original ref
and assume everything before is complete. (Actually, it doesn't even
seem to honor the --recover patch anymore, which isn't so nice
especially in case some objects disappeared from your database and you
would like to get them back. Happenned to me.)

But there were changes in that not so long ago, so maybe I'm still
confused.
