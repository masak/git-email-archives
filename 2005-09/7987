Hi Y'all,

I've been playing with export a bit, and it doesn't seem to work. Or at lea=
st=20
it doesn't do what I think of as "work"-ing.

I'm basically doing a git-export and trying to create a quilt series out of=
=20
it.

When you do a "quilt push -a" I get as far as:
06f81ea8ca09b880cadf101d7e23b500e9c164bc
[PATCH] scsi: remove volatile from scsi data

which doesn't apply as it (seems to) conflict with:=20
152587deb8903c0edf483a5b889f975bc6bea7e0
[PATCH] fix NMI lockup with CFQ scheduler

Those two commits (and others) were merged by hand in:
c46f2ffb9e7fce7208c2639790e1ade42e00b146
merge by hand (scsi_device.h)

Export gives me a patch for the merge, but it a) appears to contain everyth=
ing=20
that was merged, not just the fixup-by-hand, and b) export spits it out aft=
er=20
both of the commits which the merge merged - which is no good as quilt=20
doesn't even get that far.

I realise I'm trying to represent a DAG as a linear series of patches. But =
the=20
merge order is a linear sequence of commits, and so it *should* be=20
representable as a linear series of patches. I think.

Any thoughts?

cheers
