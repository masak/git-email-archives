Dear diary, on Sun, Sep 25, 2005 at 09:06:37PM CEST, I got a letter

Nope. rsync always did packs, I actually un-deprecated it for the time
period when HTTP didn't. The thing is, rsync is bad - it will happily
put duplicate, redundant, and especially unwanted data to your
repository, especially when the shared GIT repositories happen. HTTP and
git-daemon are much better access methods in this regard - actually, I
still like HTTP the most:

+ Works everywhere - no special setup, no dedicated service, firewalls
and proxies won't stop it
+ Works properly, i.e. only getting stuff you want, unlike rsync
+ Replicates packs setup - would be even better if it would kill objects
and packs which the new pack makes redundant

	It would be best to have some smarter git-prune-packed, which
	would process just a single pack. The other alternative would be
	that it would prune packs being subsets of other packs as well,
	but that scaled bad. I will write another mail about that.

- It is slow. Actually, I think it should be much faster for incremental
fetches, and the initial fetch should take about the same time if you
use packs. But the question is, did we already hit the limit? Are we
using HTTP keepalive connections, do we parallelize the requests?
