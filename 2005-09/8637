Actually according to Debian policy, sensible-pager is a cludge which
should be used _only_ in the case that the upstream program is hard to
adapt to a PAGER environment approach. Only in this case the upstream
package should be patched to at least use sensible-pager.

Debian prefers to call the symlink "pager" and let the sysadmin decide
where it should point: less, more, whatever. The e2fsprogs upstream
package for instance supports PAGER->/usr/bin/pager->/usr/bin/less.
Granted /usr/bin/pager is probably Debian only but every upstream author
deciding whether to use PAGER:more or PAGER:less is not _that_ much
better. 

Just wanted to nitpick. Now you can reignite your flamethrower ;-)
