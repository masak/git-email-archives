Dear diary, on Wed, Sep 14, 2005 at 10:42:50AM CEST, I got a letter
where Cal Peake <cp@absolutedigital.net> told me that...
> Any chance for a git-announce list on vger?

Did my fellow git-related maintainers not reply because they were
waiting to hpa to reply, and hpa not reply since he didn't see any
interest by the maintainers? Or something else happenned to this idea?
Would any other people find this useful?
