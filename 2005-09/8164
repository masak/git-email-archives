If you use my read-tree and change git-resolve-script to pass all of the 
ancestors to it, how does it do? I expect you'll still be slightly ahead, 
because we don't (yet) have content merge with multiple ancestors. You 
should also check the merge that Tony Luck reported, which undid a revert, 
as well as the one that Len Brown reported around the same time which had 
similar problems. I think maintainer trees are a much better test for a 
merge algorithm, because the kernel repository is relatively linear, while 
maintainers tend more to merge things back and forth.
