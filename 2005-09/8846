Even different implementations and different compression levels can lead 
to different file representations.

You are arguing on the git tool level but we are talking about HTTP 
which knows nothing about the uncompressed sha1.

The OP assumed that "files in a GIT repository are immutable" which is 
not true. If you consider the sequence

pack -> prune -> update zlib or git -> unpack

you can end up with different files if the new zlib implementation 
changes imcompatibly (with respect to byte-by-byte compression results) 
or if git suddenly does not use the default compression level any more.

And surely in the future there will be other git implementations than 
this one which may not even use zlib.

I do not say that caching is not possible at all but HTTP caching has 
its pitfalls so just be careful.
