Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 20, 2005 at 12:16:03AM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...
> How does the date thing work? It sounds like something horribly ambiguous,

Currently, in Cogito it is basically:

	git-rev-list --min-age="$(date --date=$id +%s)" --max-count=1 HEAD

The point is that you can then say

	cg-log -r yesterday

to see all the changes which happenned during the last day, and such
(so it is really useful to have the syntactic power of date(1) available).

But that semantics sucks, and I wouldn't mind changing it at all. I
think taking the previous commit works for everything but the start of
cg-log range, and it is how CVS behaves. And with cg-log, you'll just
have one commit more, not so big a deal I think.

Jonas was who introduced this, IIRC, so cc'ing him too.
