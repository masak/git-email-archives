>Why not just _also_ limit it by what is already merged in my tree?

I can add the "^linus", but I think that with my workflow it
will never make a difference.  Any commits that got into your
tree with a committer line by me will already be in my "oldhead"
(how else did you get them?).  So "^oldhead ^linus" should always
be identical to "^oldhead".

Great ... I suspected that everything I needed was already there
(after all, all GIT problems are solvable with the right arguments to
git-rev-list!)

But "git-shortlog" doesn't like the output from this, so I need
a script (or another tip on arguments to git commands).

Oh happy day when I have sub-lieutenants :-)
