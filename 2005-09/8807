Dear diary, on Sun, Sep 18, 2005 at 11:18:56PM CEST, I got a letter
where Nico -telmich- Schottelius <nico-linux-git@schottelius.org> told me that...

I think it should actually never happen, updating the references should
always come as the last thing in the push (or pull, for that matter)
process.

I believe it'd be a much more reasonable and less confusing policy for
Git to have the docs for the last release on the web. (Cogito always had
it this way, for that matter. ;-)

If that'd be the case, .git/branches is so widespread that at least
Cogito would move its content to .git/remotes automagically at some
point (it was doing such things in the past and it worked out well).
