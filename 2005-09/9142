Will try to pose it differently then, because it was not meant to make him
"look bad".  In a different email Pasky seemed to be musing that cogito
might do away with fast forward merges.  This too seemed like a decision
best left to the plumbing, so i have been wondering how Pasky views
cogito's relationship to git.

But the immediate question really was, wouldn't it be better if cogito
used the same code paths that git uses for push/pull/fetch?  Is there a
reason that this isn't possible?

Yes, cogito had it first but once this functionality gets pushed down into
git (where it's been for a while now) it makes a lot of sense for the
procelain layers to use it.   That way the functionality only has to be
maintained in one place and nobody has to guess what transports work with
cogito or git etc.  But perhaps there are reasons that this just isn't
possible with the cogito code, i dunno.
