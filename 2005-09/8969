I am not even sure what I would want to see, let alone what I
could show, when I say "show logs of what happened last week",
after I just pulled from a remote or two.

I would imagine a gitk graph with nodes colored red for commits
with last week's timestamps, would be what I would want, but
probably that is useful only because I can see in the same gitk
window how those red nodes connect with each other and with
commits outside the specified time window.  Without that context
information I would probably be lost.

Thanks.  Applied.
