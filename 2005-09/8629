I sent out a trivial "push-shell" that was meant to be usable as a login 
shell for an ssh connection that only accepted pushes (and could perhaps 
be extended to also allow some administrative stuff like creating new 
archives etc).

In that thing, push-shell.c: parse_argument() would need to be trivially
updated.

I didn't ever test it, and I never got any feedback on it, so.. If anybody 
is interested in it, I still have it, although I think a better place to 
find it is probably on the git mailing list archives. I've not done any 
other work on it.
