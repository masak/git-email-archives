Does anybody really still use tcsh? It's a broken mess.

Junio's "sq_quote()" works wonderfully on any valid shells. The fact that 
tcsh expands ! even inside single quotes is just pure braindamage.

You could expand "sq_quote" to handle '!' and '\' characters the exact
same way it handles the single tick (end single-tick quoting, do \! or \\
and start single-tick quoting again) and that might be good enough for
tcsh.

IOW, the string "a\b'c!d" would become 'a'\\'b'\''c'\!'d' after 
surrounding sq_quote with single-ticks.

Insane?
