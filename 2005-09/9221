Dear diary, on Sat, Sep 24, 2005 at 04:00:04AM CEST, I got a letter

Actually, probably not, except consistency with rsync and http handling
- but that's obviously not too good reason. I did it this way since I'm
going to be a bit busy again from now on.

I will probably rewrite the tags fetching to use git-peek-remote
(info/refs for http) the next weekend. One problem with this is that in
many repositories, git-update-server-info does not get ever run and
things would break "mysteriously". I don't want the policy that the user
has to take care of this on his own for Cogito, so I will probably add
something that will automagically append git-update-server-info at least
to the post-update hook (like

	uphook="$_git/hooks/update-post"
	if ! [ -x "$uphook" ]; then
		if ! [ -e "$uphook" ]; then
			echo '#!/bin/sh' >>"$uphook"
			echo 'exec git-update-server-info' >>"$uphook"
		fi
		# If the user added something custom and left the hook
		# disabled, he knew what he was doing. Also don't
		# reenable the hook if we already did that once.
		if [[ "$(grep -v '^#\($\|[^#]\)\|^$' "$uphook")" == "*exec git-update-server-info*" ]]; then
			chmod a+x "$uphook"
			echo "## Enabled by Cogito. It won't try to enable it again as long as this comment is here." >>"$uphook"
		fi
	fi

or something).

Actually, I might also add something like

	[ -e "$_git/git-dummy-support" ] && git-update-server-info

at all the places in Cogito where I update the refs. Then the
default post-update hook could change to

	[ -e "$_git/git-dummy-support" ] && exec git-update-server-info

and be enabled by default?
