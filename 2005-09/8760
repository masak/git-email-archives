We ignore '.git' but we let you have paths starting with dots
these days -- the change happened quite a while ago and if some
documentation still says we do not, then you spotted a
documentation bug.

After you told git about those files, you removed them from your
working tree.  "git checkout" tries not to lose your local
changes -- which means that what you removed will be left
removed (so are what you locally edited).

    $ git checkout -f

would give them back, but you would also lose other local
changes if you have some.
