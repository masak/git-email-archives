I'm too tired to search now (just after a night bus trip from Denmark -
actually, one of the bus drivers looked exactly like Linus, perhaps his
twin works for a Czech bus company?), but I believe we actually did
agree on using .git/info/exclude instead of .git/exclude in some old
now-forgotten thread, or we are having the same hallucinations.
