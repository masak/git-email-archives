It was my mistake -- git-merge does it, and I should do the
same in git-resolve.  Thanks for pointing it out.

Have you had a chance to look at the git-merge change to remove
the stupid clean-tree requirements?  I have been planning to
inflict the 'use git-merge instead of git-resolve' change on you
sometime soonish (like today ;-).  Having said that, I myself
would vote against phasing out 'git-resolve' -- being able to
say 'git resolve master hold fast' to fast forward the master
head to topic branch head of 'hold' (my topic branches are often
rebased to allow this) is quite useful.

I have one unrelated request.

Could I have a copy of .git/{branches,remotes,refs}/* from the
primary repository you do your kernel work please?
