OK, that was basically what I had planed to do, until I noticed
in your mail that there was a tool called git-diff-stages.
I just thought your removing it meant that it had become
a special case of some other tool.

But the merge heuristics usually do a pretty good job
so the user would have to perform fewer manual merge operations
if she starts off from the result of the failed merge.
(And if it turns out that the merge heuristics really didn't
work, she can still throw the results away.)

The reason I'm asking is that I used dirdiff to do a "difficult"
merge which required some manual intervention.
The way I used it now, was to load the merge base, the two
heads and the working directory (containing the result of the
failed merge) in dirdiff and then to merge the final
result into the working directory.

I still need to look at the merging stuff in more detail,
but I figured that it would actually be more interesting
if dirdiff could perform the merge on the index rather than
the working directory.
What do you think ?
