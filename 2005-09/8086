One question, of course, is if one should simply keep additional 
metadata around to handle this sort of situations.  One could, for 
example, keep a UUID for each file, which would be carried over by the 
renaming commit.  If one runs into a tree which doesn't have the UUIDs, 
they should be generated at that time (this could be a bit tricky to do 
without invalidating all signatures in the tree, since the obvious way 
-- adding it to the tree object -- would invalidate all the commit and 
tag objects.)

In some ways this is similar to the Unix filesystem model of separating 
location (pathname) from identity (device:inode).

It would also hade the somewhat interesting possibility that one could 
"remove and recreate" a file and have it exist as a different entity. 
That probably needs to be a user option.
