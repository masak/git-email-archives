Junio,
 your merge messages are pretty ugly.

You often merge from a local branch in the current tree, which is fine, 
but it generates a message like

	Octopus merge of the following:

	refs/heads/pu from .
	branch 'nuker' of .
	branch 'merge' of .

which just looks wrong. At least to me, the dot looks more like a 
end-of-incomplete-sentence than a source of data.

Also, the "first" branch is really special, since that's the branch you're 
merging _into_. 

Wouldn't it look a lot nicer if this read as

	Octopus merge of the following:

	branch 'nuker'
	branch 'merge'
	into branch 'pu'

or something?

But that still has the problem that the single-line description (ie gitk,
shortlog etc) is totally useless. So maybe we shouldn't care about the
destination branch (we don't do that for normal merges), and just aim for
something like

	Octopus merge of branches 'nuker', 'merge'

instead?

Hmm? At least for the kernel, the shortlog really is pretty important, 
because the full log is often so big that it's easy to miss things in it.
