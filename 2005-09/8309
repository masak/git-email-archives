I've never noticed autoconf successfully improving portability, and it 
seems to mostly obfuscate errors. E.g., the GNU binutils I was trying to 
build recently, if you don't have "msgfmt", helpfully runs "no" instead. 
Of course, that's autoconf being misused, but if binutils can't use it 
correctly, I doubt any other project can keep from messing up.

Compatibility workarounds with simple detection scripts invoked by people 
who find they actually need workarounds are probably best.
