Ahhhhhhhh.  That is true.  I always do "git fetch" and never do
"git pull" against anything but a local repository, heads
explicitly specified.  You are right.  The defaulting behaviour
is incredibly broken.

Do people agree it is a good idea to change the "git pull
origin" to mean "fetch all the default refs specified on Pull:
lines, and merge only the first one into the current branch"?

"git pull" without remote nor refspecs is a synonym to "git pull
origin" as before, and 99.99% of the time "git pull" from a
remote repo without explicit refspec is doing just one head
merge, so I think this is a sane default, much saner than the
current mess, while still allowing you to keep track of what's
happening in the other branches by doing fetches of all the
heads at once.

Opinions?
