If we stop using GECOS, then can we please start using $EMAIL (or
perhaps use it regardless of whether we use GECOS or not)?  A lot of
applications seem to look for $EMAIL and I think that it's universal
enough for git to use it as well.  To me it seems that both
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, and
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL can use it, as I set $EMAIL as

EMAIL="Nikolai Weibull <something@something.something>"

Perhaps I should provide a patch instead of just putting out requests?,
