Worse than that, rsync will happily sync up to a remote repository without 
even getting _all_ the object files, and never tell you anything is wrong.

This happened to several people when the kernel.org mirroring was 
broken/delayed.

So yes, rsync is fast. But it's fast exactly _because_ it is broken. Very 
very fundamentally broken.

You basically have to run fsck on your repository after an rsync. And if 
it returns errors, you're screwed unless you remember what your old heads 
were.
