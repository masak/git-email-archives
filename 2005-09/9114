Dear diary, on Tue, Sep 20, 2005 at 04:07:28AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Actually, could we please keep the old git-ssh-* stuff for a bit
(perhaps a lot) longer? The other renames are fine because people
usually keep their git-core and porcelain versions in sync, but the
git-ssh-* stuff is about network interoperability and you are forcing
other people to upgrade their installations, which may be troublesome
for them in the case their distribution didn't package the new stuff yet
or whatever.  It's just two commands after all, so could we please have
them for at least another month or so?

Thanks,
