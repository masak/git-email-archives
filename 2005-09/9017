Actually, looking closely, merge-order actually had it's own hack in the 
old filter_commit() code to make it work sanely. 

This is an updated patch that allows merge-order to continue to work.

Subject: Make time-based commit filtering work with topological ordering

The trick is to consider the time-based filtering a limiter, the same way
we do for release ranges.

That means that the time-based filtering runs _before_ the topological
sorting, which makes it meaningful again. It also simplifies the code
logic.

This makes "gitk" useful with time ranges.

[ Second version: --merge-order now unaffected by the re-org ]
