Right.

Absolutely.

Note that you can also override, so let's say that you have _both_ the
"URL:" and the "Pull:" line in your "remotes" file, the "pull" line is 
still just a default, so you could do

	git fetch linus other:myother

and it would now use the URL line, but since you specified the branch by
hand, it would ignore the default branch information, and instead fetch
the "other" branch from the remote site into the "myother" local branch.

Yes. Then git will merge them for you automatically (if they are 
identical), or may ask you to fix up any merge rejects (if there are 
clashes). 

Now, the fixing up any merges is pretty much exactly the same as under 
CVS - you'll get the same "<<<<" "====" ">>>>" markers.

Right, but git doesn't know, and is too lazy to check. 

I _considered_ allowing a dirty file that happened to match the end 
result, but I never felt it was worth the complexity. It's nasty. And if 
it doesn't match, you really can't merge, because it's too dangerous to 
overwrite the users changes (even if you use some three-way merge and 
leave the rejects there).

Yes.

The "git clone" thing will construct the original "origin" file to that 
layout. That's fairly recent, though.

And I think "cg-branch" will do it these days - and that's very much the
intent.  Havign porcelain on top of git that hides this thing so that you
don't have to edit configuration files by hand.

(Don't get me wrong: I think it's wonderful to have ASCII configuration 
files that you _can_ edit by hand, and it's the UNIX way of doing things, 
but I also think it's great to have front-end tools that allow doing these 
things without even having to understand the config file syntax etc).
