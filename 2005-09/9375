Dear diary, on Mon, Sep 26, 2005 at 10:17:32PM CEST, I got a letter
where Jon Loeliger <jdl@freescale.com> told me that...

Yes, this is basically the idea behind my "Default" line, but arguably
nicer and more flexible. I fully agree with Junio that pulling should
merge to your current branch, but I like your idea otherwise.
