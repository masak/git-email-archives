Hmm. I merge a ton of stuff, and as mentioned, I probably have a dirty 
tree at least half the time. I don't think I've seen a problem yet.

But cogito at least _used_ to have some special logic for moving patches
forward. git-resolve-script never had that - it only ever did the per-file
three-way merge, and refused to touch dirty state except for the
"everything stays the same" case.

Oh. I'm looking at the current cg-merge thing, and I think I see the
problem: it's doing

	git-checkout-index -f -u -a

at the end. That's not only unnecessary, since it uses the "-u" flag to 
"git-read-tree", but it will force an overwrite of the working tree, and 
is thus actively incorrect.

Pasky?
