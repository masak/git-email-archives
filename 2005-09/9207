Ahh, no. Looking at the xdiff format, the edits are strictly ascending in 
the destination, but they may take stuff from the source in any order, so 
it's not like you can generate a diff from it by just walking it.

Oh, well. I guess we're better off just using the external diff command, 
even if it is slower to execve an external diff. 

The GNU diff sources are hard enough to read that I don't think we want to 
try to merge the unified diff generation from there.
