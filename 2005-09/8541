Hmph.  I could almost swear that I've seen the 'recovery' fix
from Daniel and merged it some time ago -- but I do not see that
in the git-whatchanged output.  The only '--recover' I see is
the leftover command line option description to recover from
delta-fetch failure, which would not happen because we do not
have deltified objects anymore.

Thanks for the patch.
