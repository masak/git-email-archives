I am only a messenger for their argument and, as I said, I did
not particularly buy that argument because I myself do not find
it too disturbing that a grep in my built tree says "Binary file
libgit.a matches", especially I typically run grep in my Emacs
buffer and C-x ` (next-error) does not get confused by such
useless hits.  But I can understand why it matters to people
working in other environments.

Now I have to find a poor unsuspecting volunteer to do the
actual heavylifting after 0.99.6 happens ;-).
