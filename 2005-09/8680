Same option here.
The 4-phased renaming could be shortened by letting cg-pull always ask
the following if eg. .git/no-cg-pull-warning does not exist:

 Warning: cg-pull includes merging after fetch since cogito 0.15
          Use cg-fetch to do the fetching phase only
 [To get rid of this warning, run 'touch .git/no-cg-pull-warning']
 Do you want to continue (y/n) [n] ?

Getting rid of this annoying question should be easy enough everybody,
and via the template-system even for git packers...
Even if disabled, I would still do

 Remember: cg-pull includes merging after fetch since cogito 0.15
           Press Ctrl-C in the next 2 seconds to abort.
