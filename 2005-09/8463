You could check HEAD. I think the most common cases would either be that 
you just created a branch from HEAD and changed your mind, or that you've 
just merged the branch into something. Other that that, I think the common 
case is that you've made patches, sent them off, and they were accepted. 
In the first two, you're probably on the branch that includes or matches 
the one you're deleting; on the third, we want user confirmation, since 
it's external to the system.
