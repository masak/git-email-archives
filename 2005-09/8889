Yoy may find my changes to dirdiff useful if you do things like that.
(http://www.liacs.nl/~sverdool/gitweb.cgi?p=dirdiff.git;a=summary)
I've basically changed it to allow "merging" (i.e., commiting) to a branch.

You'd start it like this

girdiff master .

Then you loop through the files with differences, for each
file selecting the changes you want to copy and selecting
Merge/"update master".
Then you fill in a commit message and select File/Commit
from the commit message window.

Only lightly tested so far.
Rediff'ing doesn't work yet, so you'll have to restart
girdiff after each commit for now.
