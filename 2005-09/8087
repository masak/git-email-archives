But to the users (like myself), there's no point in naming it by
whether it's a script or a binary.  Since, as a user, I couldn't care
less that git-foobar is a shell script, I don't want to pollute the
command name space with "-script" suffixes.  Calling the command
git-foobar makes much more sense, and allows us to reimplement the
scripts as binaries, or whatever.

So your argument that it makes it easier for git developers to work
with the source doesn't help the user.

The consequence is maybe that the scripts should be called *-script in
the source, but be installed without the suffix?
