yes, i've been considering that, but i'm not sure it is really worth the 
effort.  see below -- the right data structure should be good for just 
about any git workload.

[ i'm not sure why you think insert would be O(n). ]

keeping the linked list for O(1) next/prev and delete, and augmenting it 
with a hash table to allow O(m/n) insert and find would be ideal.  with 
a fairly large hash table, we do better than a tree for any reasonably 
sized repository i can imagine.

and, i believe simply adding a hash table to my list implementation will 
be easy, and simpler overall than a tree implementation.  famous last words.

mmapping the index file is still OK.  i haven't changed the cache_entry 
structure at all.
