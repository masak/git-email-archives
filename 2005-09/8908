Hello, Petr!

Thanks for quick replies.  I'm replying to both your messages.

But cg-<TAB><TAB> does.

The value is having one command, one manpage and one place to fix little
bugs and add more functionality.  Potentially, cg-Xnormid could be
incorporated into that script, so bash wouldn't have to open one more
file.

I see.  I guess time for git is just as abstract as phases of the moon -
nobody would goes crazy when they repeat.

Please don't apply my patch yet - I forgot to document the optional
argument.  I'll try to make cg-object-id now.
