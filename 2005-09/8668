Dear diary, on Fri, Sep 16, 2005 at 12:11:38PM CEST, I got a letter

In case you were using Cogito, cg-admin-uncommit will leave unreachable
objects in the database - it's safe to prune them (unless you'll decide
later that you after all wanted the uncommitted stuff, of course).

But note that IT IS NOT SAFE to prune repositories cloned with -l or
_being_ cloned with -l. Perhaps one solution to this would be having
.git/objects/info/repousers/ or something, which would contain symlinks
back to all the repositories using the given objects database. Opinions?
