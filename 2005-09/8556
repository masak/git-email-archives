It's not about the refs at all. The issue is that, when it reaches a 
commit that we already have, it assumes that we have everything that 
commit references and stops there. It really ought to not do that, but I 
think it might be too slow if it goes through everything all the time. We 
probably want to keep a cache listing some commits we have, and use that.
