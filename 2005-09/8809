But .git/info/exclude mostly sucks, you really want these kinds of rules
in .gitignore if anywhere. E.g. CVS by default ignores some stuff and it
seems as a fine strategy for me, and is working out in the vast majority
of cases. You can unignore files by doing '!pattern', so if you want to
throw away all the defaults, just specify '!*'.
