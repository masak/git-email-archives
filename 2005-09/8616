Fair enough. This still requires "git-upload-pack" and any libraries that
requires, of course. You might want to do a statically linked version or
something.

Hmm. A quick check seems to say that git-upload-pack only does libz and 
libc. And the SHA1 stuff, of course, but that you can always get static by 
using the git built-in mozilla versions.
