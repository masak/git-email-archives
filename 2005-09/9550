Apparently my uname 5.2.1 was heavily patched by Fedora.  Note that
"uname -m" is not good enough, as it would give us i686 when i386 is
really needed.

I hate to say that, but a better alternative is to fix sparse to act
like the native compiler by default (possibly with options to imitate
other architectures or to be fully arch-neutral).

I have some hacks in mind, but I don't really like them:

Not good for i686 with unpatched uname:
SPARSE_FLAGS = __$(shell uname -i 2>/dev/null || uname -m)__

gcc specific:
SPARSE_FLAGS = __$(shell $CC -dumpmachine | sed 's/-.*//')__

bash specific:
SPARSE_FLAGS = __$(shell echo $$HOSTTYPE)__

In any case, having SPARSE variable would be convenient.
