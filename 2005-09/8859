Uhh.

I use

	git-checkout-index -f -u foo.c

which works fine. Of course, that doesn't help if you've updated the
index, but then I actually think it's fine to expose the index.

Now, admittedly, we should probably make that easier to do.

If you want to reset to the HEAD state _and_ your index is stale, I'd just
precede it with a

	git reset

and be done. Yes, it will reset your whole index, not just that file, but 
hey, big deal. In practice it works fine.

Yes, I think it would be useful to be able to read in just part of the
tree.
