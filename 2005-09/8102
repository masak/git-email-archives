To be consistent with the other tools in tools/ directory, the
above is probably 's/^/[PATCH] / unless (/^\[PATCH/])'

You could error out without asking if that is what is happening.

Martin, --mbox has the added benefit that it consistently
preserves the From: and Date: information even for your own
patches, because it implies --date and --author.  By default
without --author and --date these are not preserved from the
original commits for your own patches, primarily because
format-patch without --mbox was written for reorganizing and
reordering existing patches (i.e. export, concatenate some, edit
some hunks, and eventually feed it to applymbox to make commits;
you do not typically want to keep the original author date for
this kind of use).

I do apologize for not really saying what --mbox does and what
the format-patch output without --mbox is meant for.

Martin, is there a reason you do not want --mbox format
(e.g. format-patch --mbox spits out Subject: line undesirably
formatted while it does what you want without --mbox)?
