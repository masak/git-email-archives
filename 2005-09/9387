I would almost say: sufficient for all cases.
The .git/remotes stuff is about providing a shortcut for remote
repositories and about defaults for this repository.
I am not really sure this is needed, and this second use of a name
(additionally to head names) can be confusing.

Ah, no. Any line in a branches/ file is a pure attribute for the given
head, and does not change its 1:1 relationship.

E.g. a branches/master file with

	Push: git:/.../git.git#public-master
	Merge: origin

would specify:
- If the current head is master, a cg-merge will merge with
head origin
- If the current head is master, a cg-push will publish the
local master to the given remote URL

The branches/master does nothing say about the origin branch/head.

Hmm, perhaps. We could go with .git/push-defaults and .git/merge-defaults.
But then, IMHO .git/branches should be renamed to .git/fetch-defaults,
as it holds the remote URL needed for fetching changes.

By creating the needed defaults on a cg-clone, you can get rid of the
above mentioned hardcoded things.

It is about storing pull/push remote URLs for a given head.
Ok, in the case "merge", it is about defaults (useful to
get rid of the hardcoding of merging origin into master on a cg-update).

I really think that the "push" URL currently is missing in Cogito.
Pushing the master by using the origin URL works, but I would like to
see this working for arbitrary heads.

By the way, am I correct than cogito currently misses a command to
switch the branch? cg-seek is only for temporal switching. What are
the prefered options? A "cg-seek -f", a "cg-jump" or "cg-switch"?
