Dear diary, on Sun, Sep 18, 2005 at 01:12:59PM CEST, I got a letter
where Nico -telmich- Schottelius <nico-linux-git@schottelius.org> told me that...
> Hello!

Hello,

> My first impressions are:
> 
> - many commands, reminds me of arch/tla

this is one of Cogito's considerations, I try to keep the number of
commands low. It's 26 non-admin commands now, which might raise a bit
yet, but hopefully not by much. And I was thinking about coupling stuff
like cg-branch-* to a single command.

> - I am not able to upload cinit, because

Just fixed, cg-init should now DTRT.

>    o it's not clear to me, how I should publish (push)
>       - scp/rsync from outside
>       - git/cogito push

Push works fine for anything but the initial push - recursive scp or
rsync of the whole repository is probably the easiest solution. It would
be nice if git-send-pack would support the initial push.

>    o excluding *.o seems not to work, neither through .gitignore nor through

It should now work during the initial commit.

This was discussed on IRC, it seems signed tags were the answer you
were looking for.

Pretty much all of this solved now, I think.

cg-add -r implemented now.

This was one thing I kept in mind when making Cogito as well, I tried to
make its error messages as helpful as possible. It would be great if you
could point out where _Cogito_'s error messages might be more helpful
(it's tougher with Git, but I'm sure they'll love to make their error
messages more helpful as well - one thing I _really_ don't want to get
into is filtering Git's error messages and rewriting them ;-).
