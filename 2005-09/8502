One more merge test case you would be interested.  What's most
interesting about this commit is that it has three merge bases,
not two.

commit c820884e4f35a40f88b787c3891a23d629ef6bfd
Merge: aa2dca4563b0629ecd9d9994dfdf39f29ff1b43f 357d596bd552ad157a906289ab13ea6ba7e66e3d

    Auto-update from upstream

Attempt to reproduce this commit is somewhat troubling.  The
'stupid' strategy and git-resolve resolves cleanly and Tony's
commit matches what 'git-resolve' does (obviously that is the
algorithm everybody uses).

But the 'resolve' strategy says this is case #16 (and resolves
this case differently but I think it is just by luck). This
indicates that Tony _might_ have committed what he did not
wanted to.  The path involved is arch/mips/kernel/offset.c.

    [Tony, I think you've seen this one once in different
    commit.  The terminology "case #16" means your merge has
    more than one merge base candidates:

        Ancestor#1 -- -- Your tree
                     X
        Ancestor#2 -- -- Other tree

    and when a path in your tree matches Ancestor #i and the
    same path in the other tree matches Ancestor #j (i!=j).

    The default git merge algorithm picks a single ancestor that
    gives the least number of conflicting paths during the
    merge, and compares your tree and other tree against it and
    pick the one that changed since that ancestor if only one
    side changed that path.  But in case #16, depending on which
    ancestor we pick, the result may come from your tree or
    other tree, and obviously we do a wrong thing with 50%
    probability.

    Thie _could_ indicate that you _might_ be losing a reverted
    you made in your line of development being overwritten by
    what the other tree did.]

BTW, Fredrik, the 'recursive' merge dies with this:
