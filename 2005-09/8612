No, I did get it.

It's the Debian people who don't get it.

Expecting other software projects to make cludges for Debian-specific 
packages is _insane_.

In other word, no sane package will ever use "sensible-pager", because
it's not a sensible thing to do. Once Debian maintainers are "Big Poo-Bah
And OverLord of the KnownUniverse" and can force everybody else to have
"sensible-pager" too, maybe -then- it might make sense, but until then
it's just an odd-ball Debian thing that makes Debian maintainers either
(a) maintain stupid patches to teach other programs about it or (b) have 
normal programs that use the _standard_ pagers in the absense of $PAGER.

And like it or not, there are two standard pages: "more" and "less". In 
the immortal words: "To two shall you count. You shall not count to one, 
except on your way to two. And you shall definitely NOT count to three, 
not call it 'sensible-pager'".

The fact is, we HAVE a sensible-pager, and it is called "less".

And for old programs that assume that sensible-pager is "more", we either 
install that _too_, or we make a symlink that points to "less".

And for people who want something else, everybody already supports the 
STANDARD way of saying so: "$PAGER".

In other words, "sensible-pager" buys you absolutely _nothing_. Except for 
confusion and extra work.

No. That's NOT an advantage. It's a disadvantage. Different programs sure 
as hell will not do silly Debian-only things, so it just means that if 
Debian tries to enforce this, they're only causing more work for their own 
maintainers.

They're also causing more work and discomfort for their users, since now 
their users will have to live with the fact that they are used to 
non-standard behaviour.

And it has _zero_ upsides. Exactly because it's not standard. There's a 
lot to be said for "do it like others do it".
