I had the same opinion.  The counter-argument people raised when
this topic came up on the list was that it would help grepping
in the source tree.

I'm tempted to suggest doing something along these lines:

 - Rename things that are implemented in shell from *-script to
   *.sh, and perl to *.perl in the source tree;

 - Install them without .{sh,perl} suffix.

Once this is done, the users nor the 'git' wrapper do not have
to deal with *-script.

Comments?
