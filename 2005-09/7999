Thanks.  I'll take a look at 'test moving' part later, perhaps
this weekend.

I should give Pasky a heads-up, since I vaguely recall him
writing something about always doing 3-way merge even when fast
forwarding in his TODO list in the Cogito tree, and just in case
emu23 was what he had in mind...  I'll also CC: Catalin too
just in case StGIT is tempted to use emu23 in git.switch().

Petr, we _might_ remove "read-tree --emu23" in the near future,
but not immediately.  That will not happen until the read-tree
rewrite Daniel is working on proves to be useful in making
'interesting' merges more reliably work.
