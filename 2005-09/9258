What you'd have to do, if you chose to use diffutils stuff, is to 
transform the main() of diff in diff_main(), use setjmp/longjmp to capture 
its exit()s, and make it use a proper allocator (if you want to avoid 
leaks upon aborts). You can see an example inside the diff/libgdiff 
directory of this packages:

https://www.cvshome.org
http://www.opencm.org

In that way, instead of executing "diff -u ...", you'd call diff_main() 
with the proper args array. The CVS one (the other project seems dead, 
and they lifted the thing from CVS anyway) should be readily usable.
