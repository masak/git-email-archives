First I thought you were using the date for the cutting-off
decision and was going to object to the patch because of it, but
re-reading the code made me realize that you are using date only
to better the heuristics that limits how many commits reachable
from existing refs we would tangle to see if the newly seen
commit is reachable from our refs -- the logic looks correct.

The "complete" commit_list is a clever piece of code; I like it.
