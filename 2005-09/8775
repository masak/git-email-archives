Dear diary, on Sat, Sep 17, 2005 at 02:09:46PM CEST, I got a letter
where Alan Chandler <alan@chandlerfamily.org.uk> told me that...

Two reports about this error message in one day, and I've seen more in
the past. Heh. ;-) I'd submit a patch, but I'm still staying at the last
git release because of the command renames.

BTW, cg-add should be now (not in the last release yet, though) totally
directory-friendly.
