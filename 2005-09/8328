I had the same.  I was using bash with CDPATH; when CDPATH is in use
and you do a cd to a relative directory, bash prints the absolute
pathname on stdout during the cd.  So all those relative cd's in $(cd
xxx && ... && pwd) in git-clone and a few other places cause bash to
print the absolute path on stdout, greatly confusing the code that uses
the output text that it thinks came from pwd.  I have a patch to add
&>/dev/null in what I think are all the right places, if you want it,
but it may be easiest just to unset CDPATH and see if that fixes the
trouble.
