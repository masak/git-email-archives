Dear diary, on Mon, Sep 19, 2005 at 11:40:49PM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...
> Hello!

Hello,

well, those commands are semi-public, actually. E.g. cg-help does not
list them.

Perhaps cg-object-id? I'm not principially opposed to that, but I don't
see much value in it either. Perhaps if this would come along with
the usage of git-rev-parse (see below)...

There is git-rev-parse, but it is not as powerful (cannot take dates and
sha1 completion does not work when listing parents) - OTOH it can
complete sha1 ids even inside packs, which is really useful. Still, IMHO
its usage is awful, so it'd take place for cg-Xnormid, but we would
still keep the *-id frontends (which would also handle the dates).
