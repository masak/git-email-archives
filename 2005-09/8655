Sorry, *_gently was my fault.  The version without _gently was
there first, which issued its own complaints when it was fed a
non commit -- I presume that was OK for the purpose of whoever
wrote it first, but was not very useful when the caller wanted
to do its own "oh, if it is not a commit then I'll do this other
thing then" decision.
