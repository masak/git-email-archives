Agreed.

The one that adds USAGE.  Never mind - I see it's fixed already.

As for merging, I see that the existing *-id scripts are a mess.  For
instance, cg-parent returns parents separated by spaces, but cg-diff
used "head -1" on its output to get the first parent, i.e it assumes
newline separated output.

Another thing that is broken is "cg-commit-id origin^" - apparently the
"^" parsing is only designed for cg-parent-id.

I think I'll start a local branch for fixing this, and then I'll send
separate patches.
