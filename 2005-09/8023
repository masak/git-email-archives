I cloned them to take a look.  You_do_ seem to have a lot of
renames.

    $ git clone .../klibc.git klibc
    $ cd klibc
    $ git fetch .../klibc-kbuild.git master:kbuild
    $ git diff -M --diff-filter=R -p kbuild..master |
      git apply --summary --stat

shows that there are 36 files moved around and there are not
that much change overall between them.

Currently merge operation of git does not take any advantage of
the rename/copy detection smarts from git-diff-* family.  So
the short answer to your question is unfortunately no.

Given that they are 'related' trees, and we have proper merge
ancestry information ('git show-branch kbuild master' shows they
were merged two commits before klibc's master branch, and
kbuild's master has 8 or so commits since they last merged), we
should be able to do better.  Let me think about it a bit.
