I personally think autoconf is the devils tool, and have had much more 
luck with

 - creating "compat" libraries that implement functions that some 
   configurations don't have.

   Sometimes this involves renaming the function, in order to avoid 
   clashes with broken implementations of same.

 - just ignoring the really broken systems (old HP-UX etc is terminally 
   diseased, and simply not worth worrying about)

autoconf generates an unreadable mess that can't be fixed. Doing it by 
hand at least means you can fix it.

But hey, I don't care that much any more, since I'm not the sucker who 
maintains it ;)
