I think that is probably my problem.  I deleted all of /usr/local/bin (which 
had an earlier version of git in it) and then tried to re-install git 99.6.  
When I got a permissions error I gave up and installed into ~/bin.


But of course - that probably means that the man pages are old ones from when 
I last installed git (very early in the development cycle).
