Okay. I have to admit that what you presented is a good argument.

However, the code I usually have to deal with is comparable to what you 
read on www.thedailywtf.com, and even a "socklen_t l;" with that type of 
code is more helpful than a simple "int l;", which might even be reused as 
something completely different.

That said, in a well designed and clean project, such as git, such types 
of documentation should not be necessary.

Ciao,
Dscho
