Ah, ok.

Let me see if I understand:
1) These tags are bound to a head, and they have the invariant that they 
appear in the commit history of the head.
2) They are updated automatically.
3) When someone rebases a head, the bound tags should be synced to the
rebased head's history.
4) Tags can appear multiple times, if they happen to be in the commit
history of multiple heads?

How to make sure that the invariant mentioned in (1) always holds?

Ok, this is the "automatically updated" feature I talked about above.
So missing here is:
- If you want to get rid of a head, the tags should be removed
- If a head is rebased, this has to be detected and the tags recreated,
possibly removing some

Probably there should be a "cg-tag --recover" to resync these volatile
tags with tag objects appearing in the histories of heads?

As for lightweight tags of remote repositories, you probably need some
space to recover them e.g. on a rebase or creation of a new head without
running git-ls-remote all the time.

Sounds nice.

Tag objects in a repository could be interpreted as branch names
for commits based on it. When creating a new branch point, I first
would put a tag object on this branch, thus renaming it.
I think this would be quite handy for navigation in histories.
