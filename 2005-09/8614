Why not just _also_ limit it by what is already merged in my tree?

Ie just do

	git fetch linus
	git-rev-list --no-merges newhead ^oldhead ^linus

The problem with your approach:

This is what "--header" (and it's zero termination) is designed for: you
can do

	git-rev-list --header --no-merges newhead ^oldhead |
		grep -z "committer .*tony\.luck"

and it will give a nice NUL-terminated output list of just your commits. 
No complex script necessary.

HOWEVER. The reason I suggest adding the ^linus instead is that I suspect
people really wants to see the development stuff, and that's what they'd
get if you just run the script often enough (and daily is certainly often
enough). Also, the "grep the committer" approach fundamentally doesn't
work if you ever plan on having sub-lieutenants that work with you and
that you use git to merge with.

But hey, that grep thing certainly works too. The output is trivial to 
parse.

(Oh, and I think "-z" is a GNU grep extension.)
