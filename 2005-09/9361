I think (O_CREAT|O_EXCL) in your code can be easily defeated by
this sequence:

    one                 	two

    unlink prevfile
    rename tmpfile, prevfile
    unlink tmpfile
    local = open tmpfile
                                unlink prevfile
                                rename tmpfile, prevfile
                                unlink tmpfile
                                local = open tmpfile
                                prevlocal = open prevfile
    write local
                                copyfile prevlocal, local
    write local
				???

Not that I think the multiple instances should be prevented at
this low level --- if they stomp on each other at this level, it
is very likely the they are doing duplicated work on the network
side as well, and should be prevented from doing so at much
higher level than this, I think.  That's why I said I do not
mind BKL upfront in git-fetch.sh.

Probably not.  Just failing loudly and asking the upper layer to
retry would be fine, I think.
