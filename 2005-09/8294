Patrick and Jason CC:'ed because they also have portability
issues and seem to have good ideas about how they should be
solved.  Linus CC:'ed because he once expressed rather strongly
his dislike about autoconf.

I still keep that patch around (the patch was end of July), but
have not touched it only because I did not hear from you asking
about its inclusion.

Yes, I've used it knowing that it is marked as a GNU extension,
hoping if somebody else can supply a patch to work it around ;-).

I am slightly reluctant to do autoconf [*1*], but I might be
tempted to take patches if it is done cleanly.

As a workaround until I am convinced otherwise and we go fully
autoconf, I am inclined to introduce a new subdirectory in the
source tree, compat/, which would house compat/linux.h,
compat/darwin.h, compat/solaris.h and friends, and have compat.h
symlink which points at one of those files.

[Footnote]
*1* ...although I admit that I once used to be an autoconf freak
and even had a few lines of my own code in the official autoconf
distribution.  It was an ancient history, most likely before
libtool and automake came along.  The last time I checked my
changes were all superseded.
