I'm running git on ~5 different machines. On the box where I do my
development, I have both 'master' and 'pu' checkouts, but mostly
master. Elsewhere, I track master, with updates every few days, when
my gut feeling is that things aren't too risky. On the servers (add ~4
servers to the list), I deploy only tagged versions, usually from the
Debian package.

And it was a total PEBCAK. I had just pulled in your latest merges to
master and built/installed on a dev box, things were looking odd and I
jumped the gun badly. As you point out, I didn't even have the patch
in.

cheers,


martin
