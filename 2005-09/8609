Dear diary, on Sun, Aug 14, 2005 at 02:55:16AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Hmm, but how do you actually set the umask correctly just for git
pushing? I'm sorry but it doesn't occur to me.

I like Linus' solution, but have no time to do the patch now, so I did
just a quick dirty fix and added a chmod to hooks/update. ;-)
