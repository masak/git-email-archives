Something appears to be something odd going on with the git repos on
kernel.org, including both the git and linux trees.  I believe that I've
tracked down the problem to differences that occur between the repos
located at the various IPs that kernel.org translates to (zeus-pub1:
204.152.191.5 and zeus-pub2: 204.152.191.37).

In this case, it appears that the repo located at zeus-pub1 has been
updated, but the changes haven't propagated over to zeus-pub2 yet.  The
result is that one call fetches a list of objects, but the next call
goes to the other IP, and it can't find an object it needs, so it ends
up dying.

This is probably a temporary error that will periodically (and probably
very rarely) occur when pulling from a source with more than a single IP
and some lag before the mirror is updated.

Is this an issue that we need to watch for and program around (other
than forcing www.kernel.org's IP in /etc/hosts), or is it just one of
those things that should be such a rare occurrance that we shouldn't
have to worry about it?

Thanks,

Frank
