Ah!  You are right, there is a Dependencies file in each of the 1000+
directories and they are generated from almost the same setup, so it
must be that there is another one like the one, I just commited.  That
explains it.  Now I will try to see, if I actually can get the effect I
expected somehow. :-) 

So my new challenge to myself: Given two commit objects A and B list all
the tree and blob objects which are not in both A and B. 

After that I think writing a command which does the same as 
'cvs annotate' would be a good exercise.

Thanks for the explanation.

Regards,

Peter
