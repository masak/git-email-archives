This reminds me of what I did in my previous life, writing a
memory allocation checker -- this was before Valgrind -- and
found out that strcpy in the C library that came with Solaris
had a similar clever trick.  What was interesting was that
copying a string starting at the (PAGESIZE-3)th byte on a page
and NUL terminated at the end of the same page ended up
prefetching the first word from the next page (please do not ask
me about the details -- I do not remember the disassembly of
that part of the code anymore).  It was not an inconvenience for
our memory checker but was a real bug -- the next page could
very well be unaccessible.

The bug was fixed in the next version of the C library when we
updated our Solaris box.
