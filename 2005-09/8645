So, like, the other day Petr asked:

It took me a good long while of confusion before I
realized that cg and git were inconsistent in their
command names and meanings here.  It was the source
of Head Scratching and Not Understanding.

I am firmly of the opinion that CG should either rename 
these commands to be more consistent with GIT, or else
make up totally new, different names unrelated to git
entirely.  The reuse of "pull" alone will be, IMO, a
constant source of documentation and explanation headaches.

As with git, sooner rather than later, please.
