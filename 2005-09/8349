  Hello,

  this is the release 0.14 of the Cogito SCMish layer over GIT. You know
where to get it and stuff. :-)

  I'm sorry for the long delay - I planned to take two weeks or so from
Cogito doing a monotone-git gateway, but I really didn't expect it to
take so long, plus there were other delays. This resulted in most of the
stuff sitting in the tree idly unreleased for a long time, which was
really a pity, especially for the subdirectories stuff and robust
cg-pull.

  As usual, this isn't as well-tested as I would wish it to be, but it
appears to work (which means the usual
horrible-bug-always-popping-up-just-after-the-release is still hiding) -
in case of problems, I'll release cogito-0.14.1 quickly, though. I'm
leaving for week's holiday today (you must think I'm a horrible (lazy)
person by now...  well ;-), but I'll be able to fix bugs (and apply
bugfixes) if you won't report too many of them.

  Note that if your patch didn't get applied, it likely means I missed
it - please remind me loudly. Thanks.

  The highlights:

  * Much more robust cg-pull
  * Relevant cg-* tools work in subdirectories
  * New scripts cg-admin-cat, cg-clean
  * cg-clone -l for symlinked (lightning fast, but read help) local cloning
  * Git-compatible cg-seek
  * cg-mkpatch able to split patch series to individual files
    (Vojtech: highlight :)
  * Better cg-export (USAGE CHANGE)
  * Speedups, even better portability
  * Plenty of bugfixes

  Have fun and happy hacking,
