No. There is no opposite of pull. You can't update the tree on the other 
end. It's fundamentally an unsafe operation - the other end is by 
definition not a private tree.

(Or, if you want to see it another way: "pull" is "pull"s own opposite:  
"ssh other-end + git pull from that end" ends up being what you mean.)
