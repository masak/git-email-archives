I agree in this case.  I actually was unsure, but I decided to play safe
after reading this comment in cg-tag:

#       This is most usually the ID of the commit to tag. Tagging 
#       other objects than commits is possible, but rather "unusual". 

As for fsck "yelling to death", when was the last time you tried that on
the cogito repository fetched by cogito?  That's what I get:

It's not like broken trees are exceedingly rare.  Sure, this must be
some "better" kind of breakage, but anyway.
