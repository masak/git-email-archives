The algorithm actually used by GNU diff is pretty complicated, and I don't 
really understand the actual implementation, which evidentally has a few 
important refinements over the original paper.

I've written my own diff, mainly to try a different algorithm, and it 
seems to work, but the code isn't yet appropriate to submit. This 
algorithm also has the advantage that it can identify moved sections and 
is less interested in interleaving a removed function with a new function 
to provide the shortest possible diff. I expect that I could get it to 
work if I put in a day on it; it's mostly writing a hashtable 
implementation for non-NULL-terminated string-keyed hash tables.
