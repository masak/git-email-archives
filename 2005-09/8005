I think that is an excellent suggestion.  It looks to me that
the tag feature in ls-files needs serious renaming.

 * an option is called --deleted and the variable to control the
   output is show_deleted; the tag variable and string is
   removed and "R".  Probably the tag should be renamed to "D".

 * before "modified", tag_cached was OK, but probably "known to
   git" would have been a better name.  I'd vote for just a
   single space " " as the tag letter; if we want to use printing
   character, then a single dot ".".  Most of the things are
   "known to git" anyway so these are visually less
   distracting.

 * unmerged should be "U" as you say.
