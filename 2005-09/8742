I don't think there is any point.

git-export was done as a concept example on how easy it is to export the
git data to something else. It's much less powerful than ny number of
trivial one-liner scripts now, and real exporters would not ever use
git-export.

It's obviously much less powerful than "git-whatchanged", or just about 
any combination of git-rev-list + git-diff-tree.

So drop it.
