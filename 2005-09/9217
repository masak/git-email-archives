Looking back at what I did in the diff.c, I actually think the
part near fork() is a total crap ;-).

Originally I intended to do more work in the child process (this
is totally opposite of what is being proposed now), for example
running prepare_temp_file() after child forked, so that the
parent process does not have to worry about using memory for
expanded blob to be written out to the temporary file and then
later forgetting to free it ;-), but it seems the parent is
doing more work than I intended to.  I honestly think that the
part of the code is ancient enough to deserve a major facelift.
