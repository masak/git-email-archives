Yes. We should probably have some well-defined meaning for relative paths
in there regardless (eg just define that they are always relative to the
main GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY or something).

That would also allow mirrors to mirror the git archives in different 
places, without upsetting the result (as long as they are mirrored 
together).
