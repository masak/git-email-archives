I did actually manage to create content with

find . -wholename './.git' -prune -o -wholename './.deployables' -prune -o 
\( -type f -print \) | xargs git-update-cache --add 

and then commited it (with git commit)

The editor file that came up with this listed all the files it was going to 
commit INCLUDING some .files from the root directory (I am using eclipse, so 
I had files like .project and .classpath there).  It says in the 
Documentation that git ignores those - has it done?


I then blew away (ie deleted) a couple of directories in my working tree and 
loaded them from an earlier backup and git diff HEAD showed the differences 
of the content of these new directories against the committed ones just fine.  
I then deleted these directories again and then attempted to check them out 
from the repository with

git checkout master

None of these directories has been created in my working directory.

Does this mean that I have to manually create the directory structure for the 
files to be checked into?
