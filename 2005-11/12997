Because it makes more sense from a "git diff" standpoint to do that.

The fact that _internally_, git puts the first branch into "stage 2", and 
the second one into "stage 3", that's very much a internal git 
implementation issue that makes no sense to expose to a regular user.

Yes, but those are _technical_ docs, not docs aimed toward a user. Nobody 
sane uses "git-ls-files --stage" outside of a script, or unless they 
really know git and are trying to debug something.

>From a user standpoint, it makes a lot more sense to say "primary branch" 
and "other branch" , and then "-1" and "-2" make sense (and then the "base 
of the merge" makes sense as "-0").
