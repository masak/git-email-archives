I have a question about automatic repacking.

I am thinking of turning something like Linus' repacking heuristic loose
on my repositories.  I just want to make sure it is as safe as possible.

At the core of the incremental and full repack strategies are these
statements.

Incremental...
> 		git repack &&
> 			git prune-packed

Full...
> 		git repack -a -d &&
> 			git prune-packed

Are there some built in safety checks in 'git repack' and/or 'git
prune-packed' to guard against corruption?  In the long run, I would
feel more comfortable with somelike like this:

git repack
git verify-pack <new pack>
git prune-packed

Would something like this even work with 'git repack -a -d'?  Is there a
way to do something like the following for a full repack to achieve the
ultimate in paranoia?

git repack -a
git verify-pack <new pack file>
git trash-redundant-packs <new pack file>
git prune-packed
