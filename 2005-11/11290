it will work, but it's not optimal. this is exactly what git bisect is 
designed for.

you tell it that the prior night's version was good and the current 
version is bad. It picks a version 'halfway' in between the two and you 
test that. tell git if the test failed or not and it will then give 
you the next one to try. repeat until you identify exactly which commit 
triggers the problem.

unfortunantly I can't trivially point you at the right place in the docs.
