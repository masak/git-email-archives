Indeed. What I'm doing to get my "shallow clone" is basicaly remove
every ref/branchs I don't want, then run git-prune, git-repack -a -d.
But the result should be the same as your "shallow clone" method.

Yes. But the big difference is that, in my case, the shallow copy is
used as a public repository, whereas in your case the shallow copy is
used as a working repository. Anyway, Ralf (the mips arch maintainer)
is going to create a new pruned repository that should resolve my
problem. I'm going to wait for it instead of trying to make my own
"broken" repository.

Thanks
