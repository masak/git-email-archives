Sorry, I didn't understand this. But anyway, I have always used the
basic authentication because it has been sufficient for my needs.

I didn't even think about security implications when I sent the patch,
sorry about that. Now that I think of it, I even remember that some
browser removed this feature altogether. Yeah, it was IE:

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/834489

And Firefox seems to show a dialog confirmation dialog if I open an
URL with username and password. So I have to agree with you, it isn't
a good idea to embed the credentials to the URL.

Yes, I can manage with netrc for now. The only problem is that you
can't specify multiple usernames and passwords per host. (Or at least
that's how I understood the netrc man page.) If there's a way to do
that in git, I would really like to know about that.

Actually I'm going to be only user of the private git repository and
it's going to be permanent. I have multiple computers in different
locations (servers, workstations, laptops) and I would like to
distribute my private files (configuration files, scripts etc.) to all
of them using git. The files are not really that secret, but I just
don't want to share them with the whole world. That's why I'm using
just HTTP authentication and nothing secure.

I agree with you. I don't consider HTTP authentication secure at all.
It can just block search engines and casual readers from accessing the
page, nothing more. The problem with randomized URL (like you
suggested) is that if some person or a search engine finds the URL
somehow, then there's nothing stopping the information leak. HTTP
authentication at least stops search engines accessing the page.
