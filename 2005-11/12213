Hi,

Johannes Schindelin:

>=20
AFAIK, We have
0 - no difference
1 - produced a reasonable diff
1 - produced a bad diff because binary stuff starts
    after 4096-or-whatever bytes and diff didn't notice
2 - didn't produce a diff -- binary files differ
2 - something else broke

Right now we simply don't consider the second -2- case, because we just
successfully wrote the two files in question; there's not *that* much
that can fail after that. The second -1- case is sufficiently rare too.

So I still think a "Just write a 'Binary files FOO and BAR differ' line
if the exit status is 2" rule would at least fix the current bug with
diff 2.8.7.
