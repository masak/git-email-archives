After giving it a quick look, I don't think it locks up. It is just horribly
slow. get_all_permutations returns (nice ASCII-art follows)

    ___n___
    \
     \ ____1____
n! * /  k!(n-k)!
    /______
      k=1

permutations, which for your case (22 packs) adds up to 4194303.

I'll look into an optimization so we won't have to call is_superset
for every one of them.

OTOH, I might be wrong and it could very well be an infinite loop.
Mind running it over the night? I won't look further into this in
20 hours or so anyway.
