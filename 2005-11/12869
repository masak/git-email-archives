Dear diary, on Mon, Nov 28, 2005 at 01:59:04PM CET, I got a letter
where Josef Weidendorfer <Josef.Weidendorfer@gmx.de> said that...
> (2) project config (in .git/project.conf)

What are you going to keep in it? There isn't much of stuff which is not
per-user or per-instance. I can't think of anything now, but there is no
list of configuration variables to check yet.

(Upstream maintainer email is interesting, OTOH it alone doesn't seem to
justify the mechanism by itself; also, the upstreams may be different
based on where you cloned the project from, etc.)

If you still want per-project config, why should it be independent from
the project? Actually, like you have .gitignore, having something like
.gitconfig in project root would be by far the simplest - if you want
separate head, your merging and stuff gets quite more complicated, as
well as actually branching the project config, etc.
