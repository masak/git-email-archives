GIT 0.99.9i aka 1.0rc2 is found at usual places.

I think the source-tree-wise almost everything is done except:

 - http-fetch file descriptor leak fix; I tried Nick's
   clean-ups, but haven't tried Pasky's patch yet.  Walt reports
   neither patch fixed the problem.  I wasted the weekend not
   being able to reproduce this myself, until Pasky reminded me
   that I have an old special code in git-clone, which was
   unrelated to this problem, but nevertheless was masking it.

 - Preparation for later dash-less "git frotz" installation
   scheme.  As I said earlier, I intend to do 1.0 with a
   Makefile that installs everything in one directory (either
   $HOME/bin or /usr/bin) by default, but at least we should
   encourage our users to get used to spelling the subcommands
   in dash-less form.  Andreas Ericsson's git wrapper
   implementation was reviewed favourably on the list, and I'd
   like to go with it.

 - archimport update by Eric Wong has not been reviewed yet;
   this is difficult for me since I do not use tla anymore, and
   I am asking help from Martin Langhoff.  I am hoping Eric and
   Martin would come up with an updated patch that satisfies the
   needs of both, at that time the update will happen.
   Personally I do not think 1.0 has to wait for this.

There is a bit of restructuring in the binary packaging for RPM
(and probably Debian side needs matching change as well) before
1.0 can happen.

Anyway, here is the short-log between 0.99.9g and 0.99.9i.
Please give it a good beating.
