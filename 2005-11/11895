What about "yum remove git" ?  I don't think that will work quite so
well.  The "git" package will be removed just fine since nothing
depends on it, but git-<foo> will still remain.  Maybe not that big of
a deal, but it might not be obvious to some.

Also, what about http://www.gnu.org/software/git/git.html ?  I seem to
recall that was the reason the name git-core was used in the first
place.
