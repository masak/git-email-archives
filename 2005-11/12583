I think it's missing a "binmode STDOUT, ':utf8';" somewhere...

For what it's worth, I looked at both the above examples and the binary 
encoding in the git repository is undoubtedly correct; the two 
characters are U+82F1/E8 8B B1 (่ฑ) and U+00F6/C3 B6 (รถ) respectively, 
both of which are 100% valid UTF-8.
