Actually this is sometimes useful when rewriting history.
Suppose you cherry-pick two changes that touch the same piece
of code and combine them into a single change and then rebase
all your changes on top of this combined change.
The two cherry-picked changes will not apply and end up and
at the end of the chain where you can simply discard them.

Will the reworked rebase still support this use or is there
a better way to do this ?
