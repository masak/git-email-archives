I tried git-fetch this morning, and it said I didn't have an origin,
which makes sense because I made the tree with git-clone, not cg-clone.

However, when I tried

        cg-branch-add origin rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git

it complained that I already had an origin!  It seems to work after
that, but what should I have done instead?  Is there a way to make
both cg-fetch and git-fetch to default to the same things?

By the way, my "make only if something changed" works now, because
I've separated cg-fetch and cg-merge.  My merge step looks like:

  cg-merge 2>&1 | grep -v 'already fully merged' && make prefix=/opt/git all install && (cd Documentation && make prefix=/opt/git all install)
