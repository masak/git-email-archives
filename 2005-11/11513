Actually, that does merge very nicely.  However, I don't think its what I 
want. From gitk I get both routes back to my initial commit, both the fast 
track one and the slow train via all stations en-route.

I have had more success with grafting (which you kindly informed me about 
yesterday)

something like

echo `cg-object-id v1.0` `cg-object-id initial_commit` >.git/info/grafts

lf I make a branch out of the parent of v1.0 before doing this,  I end up with 
there being a side branch of the old history and my master branch headed back 
through a quick route to the initial_commit.

Something strange (well actually not that unexpected, the more I think about 
it) has happened though.  

I was trying to see if cg-clone would effectively me make a new repository 
without the grafts in it (ie with real commit object with a parent as 
specified via the graft) but it doesn't - it just looses the graft and 
rebrings all the old history back in

Is that a bug?
