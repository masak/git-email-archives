What it should be doing (although I have not seen this kind of
breakage myself, there could be a bug that makes rebase not to
do what it should be doing) is:

 - save the original HEAD to .git/ORIG_HEAD
 - reset the tree to origin without switching branches
 - prepare patches for changes ~6, ~5, ... brings in
 - feed that to git-am, which saves the 7 patches in
   .dotest/0001 through .dotest/0007 and starts applying them.

As the first thing to do after you see something like this,
please stash away ORIG_HEAD, like this:

	$ git branch before-rebase-precious ORIG_HEAD

After this, if you choose not to rebase for whatever reason,
including "rebase is broken X-<", you could do

	$ git-reset --hard before-rebase-precious

to come back to the state before trying rebase.

The output seems very inconsistent I am not sure why the first
message says "Applying HEAD~2", not HEAD~6.    What patches do
you see in .dotest/ directory, and are they numbered in the
right order?  HEAD~6 should be numbered 0001 and that should be
the first one that was applied.
