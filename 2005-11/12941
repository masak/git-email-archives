Are you sure about this?

In the above sequence, after you touch a with 'somelocalhack',
there is no 'git update-index a', until you say 'git commit'
there, so I do not think that mixup is possible.

The "fixup b" step is actually two commands, so after merge
command, you would do:

        $ edit b
	$ git update-index b ;# mark that you are dealt with it
	$ git commit ;# commits what is in index

After the above steps, "git diff" (that is working tree against
index) still reports your local change to "a", which were _not_
committed.

Maybe you were mistaken because Cogito tries to be nice to its
users and always does a moral equivalent of "git commit -a"
(unless the user tells you to commit only specific paths), but
you needed to special case merge resolution commit to make sure
that you exclude "a" in the above example?  "git commit" does
not do "-a" by default, and it will stay that way, so I do not
think we do not have the "Oops" you described above.

"Oops" would happen only if you did "git commit -a" instead at
the last step.
