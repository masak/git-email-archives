What I read from this, is that you could do something like (with Git,
but I suppose Cogito is very similar):

]cd original
]git-init-db
]git-add all-the-files
]git-commit -m "Initial import"
]cp -rf ../modified/* .
]git-status
...fix things up adding and deleting files
]git-commit -m "First big change

The point is, I think git-status will tell you about any
modifications you have made by just overwriting the original
tree with the modified one.
