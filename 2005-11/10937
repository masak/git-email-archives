Sorry, but what do you mean by "only rename detection but not
copy detection" in this case?

When you have "ce A B; ce A C; ce A D;... ; mv A Z", (ce is like
cp but "copy+edit") where B-Z are all new files and A disappears
from the result, trying to detect renames would end up detecting
copies without extra processing; B through Z are rename
destination candidates, and A is a rename source candidate
(there may be others), and it turns out that B-Z all look like
A.

Would it be easier to read if we say A was renamed to B, and A
was renamed to C, and A was renamed to D, ...?  I think the
current output is easier to understand than that.  B-Y gets
labelled as copy of A and Z gets labelled as rename.
