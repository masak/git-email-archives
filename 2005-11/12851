Servers with software installation restrictions are rarely used for 
development either and the server side part of git is all C. So long as 
that's true I don't think we need to bother very much with staying 
backwards compatible. It's nice if we manage it, but we shouldn't, imho, 
bend over backwards for the sake of perl 5.5 (or even 5.6).

Just my two öre. :)
