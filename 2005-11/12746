That's really weird - I can't see anything since then that could
influence it. The only possibility is that you were working on those
files before, left them modified but uncommitted, then did a merge which
would touch them, the merge would fail because of local changes, then
you would delete your local instances of the files and try the merge
again.

That's something I fixed only very recently and the fix is not even in
any public release yet; I didn't realize that it could have such
dangerous consequences, but apparently it does. I guess I will release
0.16 final tomorrow.
