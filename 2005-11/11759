How it is possible to test for success?

The codec could see everything decodable, but It's only from the context,
i.e. the user who reads, that it is possible to realize it's the wrong codec.  

Anyhow, as I posted previous in this thread, qgit-0.97.2 now has a codec selector
 as a persistent setting, defaulting to local codec.
