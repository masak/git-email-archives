What git-svnimport does right now is rather simple. It pulls the log
from the SVN URL, drops everything that does not have a prefix of either
of the -t tags -T trunk -b branches options. The prefix is then thrown
away. If it's a trunk, import the rest to the "origin" branch; otherwise
remove the next path component and use that as either the branch name
or the tag name.

The point is that the picture in the SVN manual is incomplete. 
There's not just a branches/ subdirectory alongside the trunk/ one;
trunk/ directly contains the project's files, while branches/ contains
subdirectories which are named for the branch, and *they* contain the
files.

If you're looking ahead long-term, and what you see looks like
science fiction, it might be wrong. But if it doesn't look like
science fiction, it's definitely wrong...
