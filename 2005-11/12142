Hi,

Okay, I gave it some thought. See below for my points.

Hereby done.

 Agree.

It seems natural to make variables start with alpha, since people are so 
used to it. It would not hurt the parsing to make them possibly start with 
a digit, but I think it's okay to let it be as it is.

To recap:

        [proxy]
                command="ssh" for "ssh://kernel.org/"
                command="proxy-command" for kernel.org
                command="myprotocol-command" for "my://"

It should be possible to set only the command for kernel.org while leaving 
the others. I actually implemented a function

	git_config_set_multivar(const char* name, const char* value,
		const char* value_regex);

which you can call like this:

	git_config_set_multivar(
		"proxy.command",
		"\"rsh\" for kernel.org",
		"for kernel.org$");

to change just the second command. You can use that function also to 
unset (i.e. remove) an entry:

	git_config_set_multivar(
		"proxy.command",
		NULL,
		"for \"ssh://kernel.org\"$");

There is no disagreement.

See above. For clarities sake, I left "git_config_set(name,value)" as 
shortcut to "git_config_set_multivar(name,value,NULL)", i.e. calling the 
multivar version with value_regex==NULL actually reverts to singlevar 
version.

I'll send out the patches in a few minutes (have to get them into shape 
first).

Ciao,
Dscho
