Hmm. That's really the same as the merge-base of "C _and_ (A _or_ B)", 
isn't it?

So we should be able to do that even without ever seeing the virtual 
merge. In fact, it really is pretty trivial from a technical standpoint: 
the "A _or_ B" part is really just inserting both A and B with the same 
"flags" value (see the "merge_base()" function in merge-base.c).

So in general, "merge-base" could trivially be extended to have any number 
of "OR commits" on either side, as long as there is just one "and".

It could also be extended to have multiple "and" cases, but that has 
actually already been done by "git-show-branch", I think. It's all the 
same logic, except it uses more than just two bits.

So _technically_ it should be easy to do, it would just need some sane 
command line syntax to specify the grouping.

Just handling the first case specially would be sufficient for 99% of all 
uses.  And if the multi-parent cases are slightly slower, I don't think 
anybody cares.

In fact, we _always_ do the first git-merge-base in git-merge.sh anyway 
(actually, not git-merge-base, but "git-show-branch --merge-base"). So 
that's really done already for the "test if it's trivial" case..

Junio, that points out that "git-merge-base" is another program that could 
just be removed, since it's really supreceded by git-show-branch. Or did I 
miss something?
