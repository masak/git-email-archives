I see.  I always use C locale.

Then what would you do to work with a repository using utf-8 if the current
locale is not utf-8?

I'll be away from any sane OS until Monday, but I assume my patch should help
those whose locale is set to an encoding other than utf-8 if they want to use a
repository using utf-8.

Anyway, I see your point.  Not ever git repository uses utf-8.  It is not
enforced by git.

So we have two solutions.  One is to enforce utf-8 locale in git and force all
"offenders" to convert.  That's probably too intrusive for now.

The other solution is to have a publicly available file under .git that would
keep the encoding name for the metadata (user names, logs etc).  gitk could use
that file now.  git could implement conversions a bit later.  Maybe git could
warn about mismatching encoding as the first step.
