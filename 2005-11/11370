Hmm.

Look at the "join_revs()" logic, and tell me I'm crazy.

It does:

	struct commit *commit = pop_one_commit(list_p);
	int still_interesting = !!interesting(*list_p);

in that order: it looks whether there are any interesting commits left 
_after_ it has popped the top-of-stack.

Which means that "still_interesting" can go down to zero if we just popped 
the last interesting thing off the stack.

Which seems wrong, because the thing we just popped off the stack could 
easily itself be interesting (in fact, it should be so, 99% of the time), 
and can cause other interesting commits to be populated back onto the 
list. So the "still_interesting" flag seems to be wrongly computed: the 
way it is computed now, it's meaningless.

In contrast, the "merge_base()" thing does

	while (interesting(list)) {
		..
	}

which means that we really will walk the list until there is nothing 
interesting left. Which is admittedly expensive, but it was how we got rid 
of the pathological case.

But maybe I'm just missing something really subtle. Maybe git-show-branch 
does some really clever optimization that is valid.
