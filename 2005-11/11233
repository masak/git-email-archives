Dear diary, on Mon, Nov 07, 2005 at 01:08:57AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

I want to avoid extra fork()s and exec()s. They seem to routinely matter
in orders of magnitude of speed in tight loops.

Besides, I'm more used to the dash form. ;-)

Yes. Well... you said you have the gitdir changes in your 'pu' branch,
but http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=git/git.git;a=tree;h=pu;hb=pu doesn't
appear to have the changes...?

Is --show-git-libdir already implemented?
