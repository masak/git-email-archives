Agreed.

No.

A commit is _not_ just the statement of change between two trees.

It's a statement of _history_ of the resulting tree. This is important. 
It's why a commit does not just point to the previous tree, but to the 
previous commit(s).

And that's really important. If you don't have a history of what has 
happened, then all the trees are just random collections of files. They're 
not a project any more.

So a commit doesn't just say "tree A changed into tree B". It very much 
says something much much stronger, which includes how you got to A in the 
first place.

The history is also what allow a commit to be meaningful. Without that 
history, you could never say "I fixed the bug that was introduced by xyz", 
which is often a very integral part of _why_ the change happened.

There are lots of changelog entries that don't necessarily make sense 
without knowing what went before them, so history is actually important 
even in a local sense - it's often what allows the explanation to make 
sense.
