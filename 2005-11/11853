I really wanted to do the date parsing myself, rather than call out to 
date, but I got lazy.

It shouldn't be all that difficult to do some trivial cases (gnu date 
handles totally insane things, we could easily do with just a simpler 
thing). 

Anybody want to handle
 - partial real dates ("August 5th" - figure out the year automatically, 
   and notice that it might be _last_ year since the date only makes 
   sense if it's in the past)
 - relative dates ("5 days ago", "yesterday", "one week ago")

It shouldn't be that hard, and if you do _not_ touch the date.c functions 
(which have to be totally dependable) you can be pretty damn lazy and lax 
and just guess a lot.
