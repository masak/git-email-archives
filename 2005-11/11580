This had me puzzled for quite some time. Some notice to the tutorial 
about what's meant when it says "tree-ish" or "commit-ish" would be nice 
(I still haven't been able to figure it out).

The wording in git-diff-index.txt isn't exactly stellar either. The 
git(7) man-page mentions that it's nice to read git-diff-index before 
doing anything else, but it was just yesterday before I figured out that 
it can be used to produce a diff between an updated index and the 
checked out working tree (which has led me to some fairly obscure 
juggling with patches and source-files to remember just what the hell it 
was I changed).

Oh well. Perhaps I checked in all the wrong places.
