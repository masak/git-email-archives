If it is not absolutely necessary that you need to use Cogito,
IOW, if git barebone Porcelains are good enough for your use,
the following may be adequate.

	$ echo >.git/remotes/origin <<EOF
	URL: /path/to/remote.git/
        Push: master
        Pull: master:origin
        EOF
	$ git push origin

I said "may be" because I do not understand the sequence before
"At this point"; how your local.git is initially set up to
relate to the remoge.git.  I do not see local.git being created
by cloning remote.git.  But modulo that the above should work
fine; I do that as a cheap backup on my local machine.
