Dear diary, on Sat, Nov 19, 2005 at 11:43:10PM CET, I got a letter
where Alan Chandler <alan@chandlerfamily.org.uk> said that...
> I just decided to make a repository of /etc, but because I didn't want to load 
> in all the files, I used git-init-db to create the repository rather than

cg-init -I ? Its help message would also explain to you how to make the
initial commit manually. ;-)

> I presume there is something that cg-init-db does which makes it suitable for

cg-commit will try to determine the list of files to commit by diffing
against the previous commit, but there is no previous commit. You need
to pass cg-commit the -C option in order to make the initial commit.

> and shouldn't cg-commit notice and either do it automatically or give

Good point. cg-commit will now print out friendly error message and
suggest you to use -C.

Thanks,
