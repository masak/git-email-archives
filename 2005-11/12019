Well, as long as you don't expect me to take those things..

BK had it with "bk send"/"bk receive", I used it a couple of times and 
refuse to do it again.

Yes, that sounds sane. You also need to specify the head(s) of the 
pack-file (maybe that's what you meant by the GPG-signed sha1sum).

Sounds sane.

As long as it's not me, I'd suggest doing something like

	git getmail <path-to-git-repo> < raw-email

Why? Because a lot of email clients know how to pipe the email to a 
program, so you might use this from within the email client by just doing

	| git getmail myrepo

and please also have an option to make it do the equivalent of a "fetch" 
rather than a "pull" (ie to "get" it as a separate branch without the 
merge):

	| git getmail -b garzik myrepo

or something. 

More importantly, the "git-getmail" (or whatever) scipt must absolutely be 
anal and verify that the pack is "complete". Since you don't have the git 
protocol to do the interactive "find the common parent" thing, it's easy 
for the other end to specify a commit you don't actually have, and make a 
pack that is perfectly valid, but which wouldn't have full connectivity to 
what the person that pulls is trying to get.

The minimal thing to do is to run a "git-fsck-cache" after the fetch and 
before the merge (if any). If the destination repo is regularly packed, it 
should even be fast (for example, since I repack my repo pretty regularly, 
a non-full fsck usually takes just a fraction of a second for me).
