I'm feeling slightly guilty about eliciting such a flood of help, but I'm
certainly leraning a lot.  But there's one statement that, while I'm not
doubting it's accuracy, seems at odds with the mental model I'm building.
I must be misunderstanding something.

This seems odd to me.  There's an alternate implementation that
I described that makes a lot more sense to me, based on my current
state of knowledge.  Can someone explain why my idea is silly?


I'd imagine you'd consider user editing to be a last-resort merge
algorithm, but treat it like the other merges, and leave the file
staged while it's in progress.

Either git-checkout-index or something similar would "check out"
the staged file with CVS-style merge markers.  And an eventual
git-update-index would replace the staged file with a stage-0,
just like git-merge-one-file does automatically.

"git-diff" could default to diffing against the stage-2 file to
produce the same reults as now, but you could also have an
option to diff against a different stage, which might be useful.

(This is another reason for my earlier comment that I don't think
the distinction between stage-0 and stage-2 is actually necessary.)

And git-write-tree would naturally stop you from committing with
unresolved conflicts.  You could still commit the conflict
markers, but it would be a two-step process.

You'd have the simple principle that all merges start with git-read-tree
producing a staged file, and end with git-update-index collapsing
them when it's been resolved.  (Or something like git-reset throwing
everything away.)


Having said all this, there's presumably a good reason why this is a
bad idea.  Could someone enlighten me?

Thanks!
