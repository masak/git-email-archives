Btw, this is not a new issue.

This is true even of data that _claims_ to be UTF-8 but contains sequences 
that are illegal. A program that just barfs on it is a buggy program.

And yes, I know there are buggy programs out there. I seem to recall some 
perl(?) problems when it got UTF-8 strings that weren't, and did 
impossible things.

It can't be done at checkin, since it's not _wrong_. It's 8-bit data. 

It's like saying that /bin/echo is an illegal program and shouldn't be 
executed, because it's not encoded in utf-8.

I can well imagine somebody wanting to put a binary signature at the end 
of a commit. git shouldn't care, and the important thing to realize is 
that there _is_ no "encoding" for such things. So the commits don't 
necessarily have to have a font encoding at all, and any visualization 
tool should just accept that fact.

Which is a fine option. Latin-1 is probably the right choice for the 
kernel, but not necessarily for other projects.

Another option is to just pass them through unmodified, and encourage the 
XML parser to handle it. Anything that takes UTF-8 and doesn't have some 
fallback to handle malformed input is basically buggy. It simply _will_ 
happen occasionally, quite independently of git.  You can either give up, 
or try to handle it. And giving up is always the wrong choice.
