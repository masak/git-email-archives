Probably don't want to exit non-zero, since we can deal with the rest of 
the paths sensibly. All 0 SHA1 would work, if we want to identify this 
case. On the other hand, I think the desired behavior at present is to 
tell the user to pick the correct version of the two, which is the same as 
if it's new in both sides, which is why I had it like that.

Someday, we ought to do a combined merge-base and read-tree, which would 
be able to correctly handle revert wars, but it's too very exciting 
currently, since the multi-base merge cases have generally turned out to 
be user error (i.e., the user didn't actually mean to merge those things).
