  Hello,

Dear diary, on Mon, Nov 14, 2005 at 07:20:19PM CET, I got a letter
where Carl Baldwin <cnb@fc.hp.com> said that...

  grafts are meant to be a purely local thing, private to your current
repository so that you can extend it in certain way. If you want
something public and official, that's what the "parent" lines in the
commit objects are - so you are really better off just rewriting the
history.
