For that, you'd additionally want to have the parent whose content was 
ignored be listed as "optional" in a sense; users shouldn't have to 
download all the commits that "pu" went through that have been superceded, 
unless they're actually trying to get back from a superceded commit; the 
log on that line isn't interesting (because all the useful messages are in 
the rebased line, too, in potentially better versions), and so forth.
