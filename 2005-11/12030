Yes, we had a lengthy discussion on this before ls-files
acquired the exclude patterns.

Documentation/git-ls-files.txt "Exclude Patterns" summarizes the
precedence rule, and it was done that way to allow command line
users to override what are in individual per-directory pattern
files per-invocation basis.  That is, --exclude-per-directory is
to store project defaults, and --exclude is for end-users to
specify override per-invocation.  --exclude-from has the lowest
precedence to give overall default.  The example in the
documetation has a a good illustration.

	* --exclude-from contains '*.[oa]' to catch generic
          "uninteresting" files.

	* --exclude-per-directory files contain patterns to
          catch files that are built by the Makefile in the
          directory.

        * --exclude specifies whatever the user feels like for
          the particular invocation.

If I were writing a Porcelain, I would probably install default
exclude list in /usr/lib/MyPorcelain/exclude file and point at
the file with --exclude-from.  I may also be tempted to check
$HOME/.MyPorcelain/exclude file and add it to give defaults per
user, but I do not do Porcelains, so...
