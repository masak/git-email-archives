I'm glad that it worked.

I will write something up.

It would be great if the recursive strategy could get some more
testing. I have tested it on a thousand commits or so in a few kernel
repositories and haven't found any bugs, but it could be due to errors
in the test setup, testing the wrong repositories or just being lucky. Some
real-world testing would be great.
