I think the situation is that he really wanted to update master, but 
forgot that he was on the maint branch. So now he's in a merge of things 
he didn't actually want to merge and wants to get back to not having junk 
all over the place (some files that need to be merged, some files that 
have been merged, new files, removed files, etc).
