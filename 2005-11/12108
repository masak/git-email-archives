Actually this patch series is more a response to the thread
"Re: [PATCH] Disable USE_SYMLINK_HEAD by default" in  particular see
this message 200511160205.43443.Josef.Weidendorfer@gmx.de by Josef
Weidendorfer.

We've had at least one change that was backwards incompatible, though
this was in the ancient days of git development. This patch allows git to record what
version of the git tools created the repo we are dealing with. Just in
case future changes require this.
