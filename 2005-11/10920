Personally, from my POV it is the intended mode of development only if
you keep strictly topical branches (a single logical change and fixes of
it on top of that). Otherwise, this is horrid because it loses the
_precious_ history and bundles us different changes to a single commit,
which is one of the thing that are wrong on CVS/SVN merging.

That said, with a big warning, I would be willing to do something like
cg-merge -s and cg-update -s (s as squash), with a big warning that this
is suitable only for topical branches. And I think it'd be still much
better to spend the work making StGIT able to track history of changes
to a particular patch.
