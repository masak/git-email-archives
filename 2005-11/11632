I actually don't think that is surprisingly high, and would actually have 
expected it to be closer to 50%.

On the other hand, the merges that end up being pure fast-forwards aren't 
counted as merges at all (since they don't show up as commits), so maybe 
that's what skews my preception of a big percentage of merges as being 
really trivial.

This is something where I think the kernel is perhaps unusual, especially 
for a big project. We really do encourage people to make lots of small and 
well-defined changes, and the whole flow of development has been geared 
towards it.

I do think octopus is really cool, and still think seeing that five-way 
octopus-merge in gitk in the git history was really really cool.

It doesn't look as good any more, btw: do "gitk" on the current git tree, 
and search for "Octopus merge", and you'll see some of the history lines 
crossing each other. Paul?

But yeah, it's a pretty special thing. I think its coolness factor way 
outweighs its usefullness factor ;^p

Again, this is possibly because the kernel has already had a few years of 
distributed SCM usage under its belt, and we've tried to not only merge 
in a timely manner, but also try to keep history reasonably clean and not 
have a lot of cross-merging back and forth. That cuts down on multi-base 
possibilities.

I definitely think this is true for any big project.

Small projects will inevitably have changes that modify large portions of 
the source base. But with small projects, it doesn't really matter _what_ 
you do, you can do it fast.

Big projects (at least the sane kind) will never have lots of changes that 
modify a very big percentage of the source-tree. It's just too painful 
(and I'm not talking from a SCM angle, just from a developer angle).

Well, it's self-re-inforcing. It was designed for the kernel usage 
patterns, so using the kernel to confirm that it's the "right design" is a 
bit self-serving. Sure, it's a good sign that my mental model of what the 
usage patters are does actually match reality, but at the same time it 
might be more interesting to see if other projects that use git end up 
using it the same way and/or have different statistics.

I do expect that the size of the project will impact the statistics a lot.
