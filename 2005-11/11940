git doesn't, strictly speaking, require openssh, for two reasons;
a. It's been known to work equally well over rsh.
b. ssh is run as an executed command. ssh can be installed later and the 
previously installed git will start working just like magic.

If you really *want* an openssh requirement, you should just go with
Requires: /usr/bin/ssh
It's the most accurate one after all, since git doesn't really care 
which package it came from so long as it's there.

As for BuildRequires, I think package maintainers can be trusted to 
figure those out for themselves. It's not as if they'll be producing 
flawed RPM's after all.

If you want one for expat anyways, then go with
BuildRequires: expat
since that's true for both dists (and FC maintainers will then happily 
figure out that they need expat-devel to build it).
