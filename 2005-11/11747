Well, splitting out http occurred to me, but personally I don't have a
problem with installing expat (I'd need it eventually anyway) and I
figured anyone who did have a problem would say something.  ;-)

The reason for this patch is that the RPM currently fails to build
without expat-dev.

The reason for wanting to split out gitk is that, for a machine where I
will never run gitk, I think the following dependency list is ludicrous:

 fontconfig
 freetype
 tcl
 tk
 xorg-x11-Mesa-libGL
 xorg-x11-libs
