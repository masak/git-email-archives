It hasn't. It was designed to update software non-interactively.

I *think* the ssh transport should work nicely over rsh as well. I don't 
have the slightest idea of where to find an rsh installation to test it 
with though.

True. But HTTP is a very simple protocol and git only uses a very small 
portion of curl's capabilities so it wouldn't be rocket-science to hack 
up some micro-replacement and always use the shipped stuff.

That depends on how it's used. If some script expects 'merge' to be 
there and does things that might break the index if it isn't, then it's 
required.

It could require /usr/bin/merge instead. Seeing as people who install 
packages usually installs other things as packages too this would 
probably make more sense.

Still though, be kind to the fairy godmother. ;)

The change would only mean that all packages will come from the "git" 
SRPM rather than the "git-core" SRPM so this point is moot unless there 
will ever be such a thing as the "git" SRPM to contend with (which will 
be less likely if we're it, so to speak).
