Yes, but that doesn't really change the problem: you can't _visually_ see 
what is wrong in most editors (some editors end up showing tabs as 
something that isn't quite whitespace, but that's also really irritating).

This is like Makefiles: if you have spaces in the wrong place, it may all 
_look_ fine, but the Makefile just doesn't work. Really irritating.

And obviously using the file will show the problem (the parser will 
complain with a nice line number and readable error, hopefully), but I 
personally find that to just be too damn late. By then, you're already 
irritated.

So I like the notion of depending on indentation, but I just feel it falls 
down in practice. 

Of course, since I believe that tabs are always exactly 8 characters, I'd 
also be perfectly happy to just declare that anybody who disagrees with me 
is a moron and deserves to die (*).

(*) That's obviously true of _anything_ that people disagree with me on,
but at the same time, I have this nagging suspicion that it's just better 
to not depend on indentation.
