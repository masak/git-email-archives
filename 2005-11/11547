I sometimes want that too, but git doesn't have a 'rewind' semantics,
and probably for a good reason. The approach I am studying is to
create a thousand throaway short-lived branches. It is safe to publish
them as long as people following your branches _know_ that they'll be
orphaned, and that any commits they have on top of them they'll have
to rebase.

So you could publish your tree with devel-<datestamp> heads, and
announce when you're moving to a newer one. People tracking your
branches can tend register & checkout the new branches, and do a
git-merge to rebase their patches to your new branch, or replay them
with git-format-patch and git-am.

On the other hand, if  StGIT grows better support for sharing patches,
it could make all this look like the stone age.

cheers,
