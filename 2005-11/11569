Dear diary, on Fri, Nov 11, 2005 at 07:56:29AM CET, I got a letter
where Alan Chandler <alan@chandlerfamily.org.uk> said that...

It seems to be part of the error message. This is wget's error anyway.

It require_d_ in the past that refs/tags/ would have directory listing
permitted.

This is no longer the requirement right now and in 0.16rc1 (which I
released the last night, but didn't get to write announcement for it
yet).
