The ${parameter##word} syntax is in IEEE 1003.1-2001, and bash,
ksh, and dash seem to work with it.  That does not necessarily
mean it is "portable" but I won't be so worried about shells
that do not grok this.  Input from people on non-Linux platforms
are appreciated.

I wonder if you meant "${com1%^}" here, to remove the trailing '^'.

N generation back in extended SHA1 notation uses a tilde '~',
e.g. "HEAD~5" is five commits back from the current HEAD, so I'd
prefer being consistent with that (HEAD^5 means the fifth parent
of an octopus merge commit).  Also limiting to between 0 and 99
generations misinterprets "HEAD~123".

Although checking only the letter that follows the tilde is a
digit mistakenly accepts something like "master~1-bad-one", that
is already malformed and whatever comes downstream would barf,
so that may be fine.  How about something like:

	?*'~'[1-9]*)
        	range="$com1..${com1%~*}" ;;
	'~'[1-9]*)
        	range="HEAD$com1..HEAD" ;;

I do not have aversion against echo piped to sed in general, by
the way.  I *would* redicule people who write something like
this, though:

	case "$git" in
        */.git)	printname=`echo "$git" | sed -e 's/\/\.git$//'` ;;
        *)	printname=$git ;;
	esac

It should be spelled `expr "$git" : '\(.*\)/\.git$'` (or
"${git%/.git}" if we know the shell is POSIX), for this
particular one, since we already know it ends with "/.git".  But
if all you want to do is to drop an *optional* trailing "/.git"
(i.e. your input may or may not end with "/.git"), a single:

	printname=`echo "$git" | sed -e 's/\/\.git$//'`

without surrounding case may be adequate; it forks sed when it
does not have the optional /.git part, though.  And if you are
dropping optional /.git or .git (think of prettyprinting
uemacs/.git and git.git), then echo-to-sed without surrounding
"case" is probably easier to read:

	printname=`echo "$git" | sed -e 's/\/*\.git$//'`

unless you want to avoid fork, in which case it would be:

	case "$git" in
        */.git) printname=${git%/.git} ;;
        *.git) printname=${git%.git} ;;
        *) printname=$git ;;
	esac
