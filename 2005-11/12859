Dear diary, on Mon, Nov 28, 2005 at 03:01:18AM CET, I got a letter
where "Randal L. Schwartz" <merlyn@stonehenge.com> said that...
>     localhost:..Git/Play/local.git % cg-branch-add origin "$(cd ..; pwd)/remote.git#master"

BTW, it should be fine to just say ../remote.git#master.

>     localhost:..Git/Play/local.git % cg-branch-ls
>     origin  /Users/merlyn/Projects/Git/Play/remote.git#master
>     localhost:..Git/Play/local.git % 
> 
> At this point, I'm where I was before.  And this next step worked,
> although I had to say "origin":
> 
>     localhost:..Git/Play/local.git % cg-push
>     WARNING: I guessed the host:path syntax was used and fell back to the git+ssh protocol.
>     WARNING: The host:path syntax is evil because it is implicit. Please just use a URI.
>     ssh: \033]2;[zsh] localhost: No address associated with nodename
>     fatal: unexpected EOF

I did the exact same sequence of commands and everything works just fine
for me with both the latest master and the latest v0.16. What Cogito
version do you use? Are you sure the origin location is just the local
path at the time of cg-push?
