I'm deliberately breaking up the thread here, not to make the list
reading even more difficult for all the poor readers not so interested
in electronic archaeology (but I feel better after I began taking my
new meds, I can even resist this huge urge to start replying to mails
from June).

Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 10, 2005 at 09:11:47PM CET, I got a letter

Is it correct that all there is to it is to check if cloning locally
works properly with symlinked HEAD in the remote repository?

I personally would not mind getting rid of symlinks completely, but we
will still have to support them for some reasonable time period (several
major releases, as far as Cogito is concerned - actually, there is
plenty of people still using 0.13 and such).

If more people think this is good idea, I could even again introduce
some compatibility code to cg-Xlib which will rewrite symlinkish HEAD
when it hits it (the kind of stuff we did in the old times).

I didn't notice such a discussion yet.
