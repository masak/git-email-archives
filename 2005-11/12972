What does "git-diff-files" do? Just output a lot of nasty "unmerged" 
messages?

The _nice_ thing to do would be to output one "unmerged" message, but 
then diff against stage2 if it exists (and it basically always should, 
since otherwise we wouldn't have gotten a merge error).

If it did that, then you'd have the best of both world: the old nice "git 
diff" behaviour _and_ being safe (and saying that it's unmerged).

Something like this (untested, of course).

It _should_ write out

	* Unmerged path <filename>

followed by a regular diff, exactly like you'd want.

[ This all assumes that merge-one-file leaves the stages right. I think my 
  patch to do that was just broken. Yours was probably not. ]
