Um, okay, but I don't see why you changed...

Yes, exactly.  This is what I expected.

You seem to be saying that producing a merge with conflict markers is
what you (almost) always want, so it's the default.  No objections.

But why collapse the index and only keep stage2?  Why not leave all
stages in the index *and* the merge-with-conflict-markers in the working
directory?

They you could, for example, try alternate single-file merge algorithms
on the conflict, or regenerate the conflict markers if you wanted.
By keeping all of the source material around until the user has decided
on a resolution, you achieve maximal flexibility.

This is no more effort for the user to use in the common case (edit the
conflicts and git-update-index), but lets you try various things in the
working directory and eaily back out of them.  ("git-merge-index -s manual
-a" would regenerate all of the conflict markers.)  And it prevents a
checkin until the matter has been resolved.


I'm wondering if this isn't a philosophical issue.  One side says that,
since all automated merging is complete, the stages should be collapsed.
To me, it makes more sense to leave out the adjective "automated" and
consider the merge to be incomplete; we're just putting the user in the
loop when software fails.
