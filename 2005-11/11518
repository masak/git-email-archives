Huh. But you still have the history cluttered and both routes to your
initial commit, don't you? I'm now confused - I fear I don't know what
you want anymore. But well, whatever is working out for you... ;-)

So far grafts were considered a private thing to enable some cool things
like tying ancient history to your current history tree, etc. But if you
want to do some persistent changes in the DAG, you are really best off
just rebuilding the whole history.
