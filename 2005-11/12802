Well, but -l links the files instead of copying them, right? That's
certainly not what I want, I want to really _copy_ the files. Also, does
cpio preserve the hardlinks between the copied files? If not, then what
you wrote is equivalent to

	cp -pRP

which should be even POSIX, hopefully. That's what I changed the -dpR to
now.
