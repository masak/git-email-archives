Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 10, 2005 at 11:52:46PM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...

Yes. You can cg-clean, but that'll wipe out other stuff as well. I plan
to fix that by adding some conflicts tracking to Cogito - I'm not yet
decided on the particular implementation (only that I certainly don't
want to require the user to manually tell Cogito about resolved
conflicts).
