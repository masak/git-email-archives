There are two reasons to avoid git-merge choose from more than
one strategy.

1. The whole idea that git-merge implements "goodness" metric is
   bogus.  It does not know what merge strategy is good and that
   is the reason it punts and has the user choose his preferred
   strategy.

2. When it is going to loop over more than one strategy, it
   stashes away the current working tree state, so that the
   second and subsequent strategies can begin from a clean slate
   (including local modifications since the current head).  If
   we try only one, there is no such cost involved.

I think the patch I sent out last night to change the recursive
as the default strategy and make it overridable from the
configuration mechanism would be a better way to give people
more exposure to the greatness of recursive while protecting
them from potential glitches if any.
