Because -1 means "first branch" (usually "ours", aka HEAD), and
-2 means "second branch" ("theirs", aka MERGE_HEAD), and -0 is
for the base (aka merge base)?

But I think you are right.  The numeric parameters should match
stage number for consistency.

How about if I redo the patch to make diff-files accept -1/-2/-3
instead, and in addition accept "--base", "--ours", and
"--theirs" as synonyms?

Side note.  diff3 says MINE OLDER YOURS and the way to remember
the order is they are alphabetical.  We can say the same for
base, ours and theirs.
