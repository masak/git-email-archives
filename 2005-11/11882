This was the case with the first StGIT implementations but I slowly
began to want to only use StGIT and not switch to something else for
trivial SCM operations. I eventually added 'stg commit' which stores
the patches permanently into the base of the stack to enable some kind
of maintainer mode for StGIT. My main use for this was to import
patches directly into the main branch and not keep a separate one and
pull between them.

The gitmergeonefile.py script in StGIT adds every conflict to the
.git/conflicts file which is read by 'stg status'. My goal is not to
leave any unmerged entried in the index even if there are conflicts.
Maybe this could be changed and .git/conflicts file avoided entirely.

Anyway, while I'll try not to add more SCM functionality to StGIT, I
don't think I should remove the existing add/rm/status functionality.
It's just handy not to use a different command when you want a new
file added to a patch.
