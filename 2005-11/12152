But would a git-diff-tree still show the changes between the current
files and the index if there are unmerged entries? I haven't tried it.

When I started writing StGIT, my main thoughts were driven towards the
patch merging/commuting via the diff3 algorithm. I found it simpler to
copy the algorithm from git-merge-one-file since that wasn't my main
interest in StGIT. I also looked at how Cogito did it.

I agree with this.

I know that diff3/merge support labels. I don't exactly remember my
reasons but I think that I chose those namings because StGIT was
supporting another type of merge where "patched" etc. did not apply.

I agree that we should change them. I would rather use "ancestor",
"patch" and "base" but I don't have a strong opinion.

At the moment, the conflicts usually leave the index in the state
before pushing the patch. I think it should also leave the file and
just mark it as conflict in .git/conflicts.
