That is what I meant by "it does not show just what you saw".
It shows the whole community experience by everybody who has
commit there.  Being _the_ integration point, I imagine that
most of the pure fast-forwards you saw were real merges for
somebody else, and that merge being fast/safe/convenient
counts, not for you but for your subsystem people.

That is true.  My point was that it's not like git was done
right only for _you_, sacrificing subsystem people.  The sample
4k commits show that the assumption of the usage pattern git is
optimized for actually holds (commits being small, merges being
mostly trivial) for kernel people other than you.

It is yet to be seen if the same assumption holds for other
projects.
