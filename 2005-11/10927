I'm probably not familiar enough with stgit, but it
looks to me as though you're tracking individual patch history only.

In trees I work with, patches rarely stand alone.  There are typically
collections of patches implementing a given feature, or a change to one
patch requires rebasing a number of (perhaps unrelated) others.

I think the command set you describe above will lose that grouping.
