I don't blame you. Binary patches aren't something I normally create
either. It's just that I find stgit patches a good way to logically
structure a largeish change that I'm working on before committing it.
(I could probably accoplish the same thing with one branch instead of
each stgit patch, but then it would be quite a lot of work to manually
push updates through all the branches.)

Yes, at least if stgit is going to continue to use it like this.
Refusing to handle binary files is somewhat disappointing, but still
OK; agreeing to handle them and then silently wiping them is a bit
less OK. (But don't worry; it is a perfect world, after all, so of
course I had backups. :-)
