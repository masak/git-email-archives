Scanning the list, 2 are related to option handling (one of which is
builtin), one isn't used (Data::Dumper), and two are related to sending
valid emails. The email address verification is ridiculously hard to get
correct, so using pre-written code for that seemed justified.

You can use --no-chain-reply-to in git-send-email.perl, and put a 0/N
message in, and all subsequent replies get attached to that instead of
in order, if you want.  This keeps everything in one thread, but all as
responses to the first email, so the people that want everything in one
thread can get that behavior.
