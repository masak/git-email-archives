Dear diary, on Fri, Nov 11, 2005 at 12:13:57PM CET, I got a letter

Aha. So it isn't so much about modules, but more about nested checkouts,
described in Cogito's TODO as:

* Subprojects
	Support a GIT project inside a GIT project:

		x/.git
		x/foo/bar/.git
		x/foo/bar/baz/.git
		x/quux/zot/.git

	That means cg-update working recursively and cg-add'n'stuff
	checking if there isn't another .git along the path of its
	argument.

	Needs more thought, especially wrt. fetching and merging
	recursive semantics.

Yes, that would be nice - it is something that you get kind of for-free
in CVS given its internal architecture, but needs specially crafted
support in the GIT environment. But when thinking about it (and we
discussed it with Jonas during one night bike ride through Copenhagen
some time ago ;), most of the problems with fetching and merging
semantics turn out to be actually largely artificial, and just doing
the intuitively right thing should be ok.

Patches welcome. Otherwise, I will get to it, but not very fast. :-)
