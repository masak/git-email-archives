Come to think of it, git-merge-octopus does AND.  If I am
merging topic branches 1, 2, 3,... N into my master, internally
it does an equivalent of merging 1 into master, then 2 into the
result, then C into that result,..., and it uses merge-base of
all the heads merged so far and the original master to pivot on.

And I think this is *wrong*.  The merge base of each step when
merging head N does not have to be older than merge base of the
original master and head N, but currently that is not what it
does.  I should be ORing them ideally, but even if I do not, I
should be able to just use the merge base of head N and original
master.
