I don't have the old packs anymore, but I benchmarked all three
allocation types anyway:

malloc/free:

$ time git-pack-redundant --all --alt-odb
real    0m0.092s
user    0m0.108s
sys     0m0.015s

simple node reuse (the patch in official tree):

$ time git-pack-redundant --all --alt-odb
real    0m0.074s
user    0m0.093s
sys     0m0.015s

slab node allocation (your concept patch):

$ time git-pack-redundant --all --alt-odb
real    0m0.031s
user    0m0.046s
sys     0m0.015s

This repository has one pack and 17758 files.
