Yes, but the problem is when that "someday" comes.  Unlike a
single machine installation where we can tell "git" to look into
somewhere different at the same time we move the subcommands out
of /usr/bin, "the other end" can lag behind and sometimes not
under control of the end user.

I think it's simpler to manage and can be made configuration
free if we keep receive-pack and upload-pack in /usr/bin and
always call these programs in dash-form (i.e. not "git
upload-pack") from the other end.  .bash_profile is not read for
incoming ssh connections to execute a single command, but many
people set their PATH in there, without setting PATH in .bashrc.

I personally think that having to set PATH in .bashrc it is
actually a bug in what bash does, but that is OT.
