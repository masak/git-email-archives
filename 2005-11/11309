Attachments are a bit cumbersome to quote but otherwise OK, at
least for me.  Linus never admits it, but I am hoping that he is
having a bit easier time applying e-mailed patches ever since
rudimentally MIME attachment handling was added.

However, please note that git-mailinfo which splits a piece of
e-mail into metainformation and patch part takes commit log
material only from the main message part, so having this
one-line explanation inside attachment is like having it under
the three-dash line.

I think this case you meant to do that; your main message part
was almost fine as is, as a commit log message (except perhaps
the initial "Hi," part ;-).

I wonder what this thing is, though.  I sense that usage()
cleanup patch that makes programs state their names
semi-automatically is coming...
