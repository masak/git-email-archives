That is going away. No more /usr/X11R6/{bin,lib,man} junk.

AFAIU, /usr/libexec/git (or /usr/libexec/git-<version>) would be better.
Including the version would make it possible to have the last stable and a
development version coexisting, like gcc does with -V. Or its -B option,
which tells it where to find the executables that do the real work.

Explicitly saying where to find all the stuff with -B would help here.


The only downside is that git-<TAB> won't find them anymore, but I'm sure
the bash-completion people will fix that soon ;-)
