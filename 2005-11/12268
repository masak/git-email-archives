No, that's something I will *not* do.

Linus is right --- he is always right but he is slightly more
right than he usually is in this particular case ;-).

We allow any 8-bit data in commit log messages.  We even make it
easier to use utf-8 than other encodings, and we encourage use
of utf-8 for obvious reasons.  But we do not go further than
that.  Any patch to change commit-tree.c to reject binary data
in a commit log message that utf-8 validator chokes at *will* be
rejected.

Go back to the list archive.  Dig out messages on this topic.
Summarize the ones that say why we encourage utf-8 in textual
commit log messages, submit a patch to add that to
Documentation/howto/ or perhaps Documentation/tutorial.txt, to
further encourage people to use utf-8.  Just do not forbid non
utf-8 text nor binary data in general.
