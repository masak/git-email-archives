Dear diary, on Tue, Nov 01, 2005 at 05:17:30PM CET, I got a letter
where Joel Becker <Joel.Becker@oracle.com> told me that...

Well, ok, so I assume you are indeed using strictly topical branches.

cg-pull just fetches stuff, no merging done.

Ok, in theory you do not actually need to fetch the intermediate history
in case you are going to squash (unless you are going to default the
final commit message to concatenation of the intermediate ones), but
arranging that would not be easy to arrange with the current git tools,
I think. And neither feasible. But actually, I would like to do
something like this later, support for CVS/SVN-like tracking by always
having only the latest tree and no intermediate states, so that people
who just want to run the latest and want to do no development are not
forced to download anything useless for them.

Well, if you are already going to deform the history, StGIT (able to
track patch history) is just the best tool for that.
