Shouldn't approximately this be what git-clone sets up for you? If it's 
getting those heads initially, it should keep the information for future 
use. The only thing it wouldn't know would be the "+" on pu.

On the "pu" issue, maybe "pu" shouldn't be a branch, but should be 
something different, like a tag. I think, actually, that a tag would 
describe "pu" pretty well: no development happens on its line; rather, 
development happens elsewhere (topic branches), and a merge of some of 
them is then released as being interesting. What is interesting as "pu" 
today isn't necessarily related to yesterday or tomorrow. Then you 
wouldn't exactly be rebasing things all the time, but you'd instead be 
marking different and unrelated commits in the same way at different 
times. (Probably need to do more to handle the case where a tag ref 
changes and define the semantics properly)
