You're allowed to do the two-way merge with your index empty, and this 
means that you just hadn't read the ancestor, not that you want to remove 
everything. I'm not sure what this is useful for.

You're definitely allowed to do a three-way merge with your index empty, 
meaning that you don't have any local changes at all, which lets you do a 
merge in a temporary index that didn't exist before. (The two-way case is 
less interesting, because it's the same as just reading the new tree.)
