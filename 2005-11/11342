You could perhaps do "make" without install and set PATH to
include the source directory (you need to do a bit more if we
ever update templates/ directory and you would want to try it). 

The point is that git-pull was generated with +x from
git-pull.sh, and the mode bits of git-pull.sh (source) does not
matter anymore.  It used to matter back when we called them
git-*-script but not these days.
