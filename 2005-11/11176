I agree with you. I have 3268 entries in /usr/bin and git commands 
account for 3.3% of this number which is a lot.

In addition custom tab completion can be quite easily added to bash and zsh.

If you indeed put only git in /usr/bin, a good idea would be perhaps to 
implement (svn does that for instance) : "git help" to have a simple 
list of command (this is almost already there),  and "git help  
<command>" which can give the same result as "man git-<command>" because 
it's not clear from "man git" that one needs to see the man pages of the 
commands listed in "Porcelain-ish command".
