Well, obviously I would patch git-fetch/-pull/-push to have an option 
("--store") to store the current parameters under a certain nick name in 
the config ;-)

Or add a little option (which is easy) to generate commands which can be 
piped into a little script (think "xmodmap -pke").

I wouldn't be so sad about the flexibility. It is an open source project, 
and the strength therein lies in many people having many (yes, even 
stupid) ideas, and trying to get them in. In the long run, the dumb ideas 
are thrown out, but what remains is a collection of gems.

So, it might be confusing for a noobee, but that's what we have 
Documentation/tutorial for.

'xactly. For example, I can do

	ln -s .gitgrafts .git/info/grafts

and have the effect that Linus just called "nasty". Point is, if I choose 
to do so, I can. Easily.

Ciao,
