Cogito uses the same logic and underlying GIT fetching commands for
cloning as well as for fetching, while git-clone uses some custom logic
for cloning ("dumb http clone"). (In fact, is there a point in carrying
it further now that git-http-fetch got as smart as it got? You'll have
less code, and more importantly see bugs in the fetchers otherwise only
I see with Cogito. ;-)
