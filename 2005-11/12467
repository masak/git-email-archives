Okay. (I also wondered how git-config-set could be used to replace the 
first pair, which is what gets merged when pulling).

(1) git-var -l | grep '^remote\.'

(2) I would add --remove-section for that. (Though I'll wait to implement 
that until I know if people want it.)

Ahh! I have a clear picture of what *I* would put into it: all interesting 
static data about that particular repository which I would not like to 
version.

For that matter, .gitignore would stay where it is, though I'd also like 
to version grafts, i.e. move the location from .git/info/grafts to 
.gitgrafts (which would effectively end another thread on this list).

I would not like to version refs, evidently, or alternates. But the refs 
would not be static (they *want* to change often), while the alterates 
would be.

But I will not be a bugger about it. If things stay where they are 
(including .git/remotes), I will not be sad. There was just this crazy 
idea in my head (not the tip of the development branch, but the object my 
eyes are in), and I wanted to discuss it with you guys, just in case...

Ciao,
Dscho
