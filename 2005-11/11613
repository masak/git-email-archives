Just to be anal;
Requires doesn't usually include the %release, since that's supposed to 
represent changes in the spec-file rather than the source (although 
patches included in the spec-file often counts as a new %release, but 
that's no reason to make it so in the official spec).

I really have to sobner up and get cracking on that spec-file thingie 
stuff. Or some such.

Cheers for the beers and review of the peers.

Hooray for firday. ;)
