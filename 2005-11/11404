I am trying to set up a public repository on my server to which I can push 
stuff

I have just downloaded the git-core-0.99f-tar.bz2 file and untarred it as me 
(alan) on account on the server.  My home directory is at /home/alan

Went in as me into the git-core-0.99f directory and did a make

Then became ROOT and did 

make prefix=/usr/local install

(I also built the documentation but I don't think that is relevent)


Separately AS ROOT I have gone into the directory where I am going to build my 
repositories (/var/lib/git) and tried to build the repository as per the 
tutorial.


roo:/var/lib/git# mkdir famtree.git
roo:/var/lib/git# GIT_DIR=famtree.git git-init-db
warning: templates not found /home/alan/share/git-core/templates/
roo:/var/lib/git#

git-init-db seems to have got the wrong place for the templates - ie the 
account where I originally built the code.

(NOTE: the templates have actually been installed 
in /usr/local/share/git-core/templates)

I had to do a make clean, but following that I did

make prefix=/usr/local 

for the first part,  and then re-installed (also with the prefix) and it 
solves the problem

I don't know whether this is something that can be fixed at install time, or 
whether the README should be changed to make it clear that you need the 
prefix on the first stage of the process as well as the second.
