I am trying to take my current development repository which has several 
hundred commits in it as I was developing my application and make a 
simplified branch for pushing to my public repository.

I basically created a new branch (public) from the tag at the point where I 
started the repository.

git-checkout -b public initial_commit

I then did a merge

cg-merge --squash v1.0

This seemed to work fine (although it had trouble prompting me with an open 
editor to edit the commit message)

But I don't know how to move forward and merge in changes after my v1.0 tag.  
Any attempt to merge anything else into this "public" branch seems to throw 
up what appears to be merge conflict, but I can't see why - when I look at 
the results one side has extra lines, but there is no other overlap.
