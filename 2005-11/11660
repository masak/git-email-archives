It can be served over http, though the repo needs to be setup with
some special options. You can easily setup a mirror that works over
http, though I can't remember the exact options.

Cool. That's good to know...

The archimport script was written and tested against the branches I
maintained in Arch, which had a reasonably rich and messy scheme of
branching, cherry picking and replaying of patches. We just imported
some additional branches from an unrelated project and it worked
pretty well. So cherry picking/replaying itself should not be an
issue.

On the other hand, some versions of tla are notoriously sloppy in the
patchsets they generate, forgetting to add files or adding them in two
consecutive patchsets. I don't think archimport is too tolerant, and I
did find some particular patchsets that wouldn't work correctly.

I'm interested in patches that make the import more resilient, though.
So if you can fixup archimport so your import works, and the patch is
sane, I'll vouch for its inclusion.

cheers,
