I think many of the scripts rely on git-apply failing reliably
for unapplicable patches.  I'll do a new test script in git.git/t
and if it fails on binary files, try to fix it today.

Incidentally, for the last couple of days, I was working on
adding a very limited binary file diff support to "diff piped to
apply" pattern, and the result has been posted as "reworked
rebase" patches.  It is very limited in the sense that the diff
output does not attempt to be useful if the patch consumer does
not have both pre- and post-image blob, but for the use of
StGIT's internal patch replaying purposes that is not a concern,
so you might be interested in taking a look.
