Thanks, but I think this one is wrong.

In setup_git_env() you have only read GIT_DIR environment but
have not done the toplevel discovery.  Especially, this is
called from get_git_dir(), and you call that as the first thing
as setup_git_directory().  However, that function is supposed to
be callable by processes that are in a subdirectory, without
GIT_DIR explicitly specified, and the place get_git_dir() is
called in that function is way before the discovery of the
toplevel happens.  Until then, you do not know where your .git/
directory or .git/config file is. If you start in Documentation
subdirectory in git project, your setup_git_directory() would
first call get_git_dir(), which says "I assume the config file
is at ./.git/config -- oh there is no such thing".  At that
point you are checking Documentation/.git/config.  

It would happen to work because you intend to allow version 0
repository for any future version of tool, and even if this
codepath mistakenly thinks the repository is version 0, it does
not hurt, as long as your setup_git_directory() calls
check_repo_format again after doing the toplevel discovery and
checks the true .git/config file, but I do not think you have
that call in the current series yet.  Even if you had, this does
not feel quite right to me.
