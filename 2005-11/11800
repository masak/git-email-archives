Andreas

Could you cc me when you're responding to my questions since I'm not
subscribed to the GIT mailing list for now...thanks

git-branch -d option is not documented on online documentation at:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/
That's why I didn't find it by my self...

Regarding the second question, your feeling is wrong.  What you
described is well documented in the git tutorial. There's no "hidden"
question behind the one I posted in my first email. So the question is
still: Is there a way to get information about the working repository
? For instance if I create a branch which is not based on the current
HEAD position of master branch but instead is based on a previous
poisition of master branch.  Then later I want to know how I create
this branch, how can I get this information ?

Thanks
