Dear diary, on Fri, Nov 04, 2005 at 06:43:04PM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Well, that obviously works only when you resign on the workflow where
pull means fetch + merge, since your local master would conflict with
the remote master, therefore having nowhere to store the remote master.

I still believe we need the notion of private tags which shouldn't be
cloned.

Hmm. Wait.

All right. git-update-server-info ignores hidden refs, but referencing a
hidden ref works all right (unsurprisingly). So let's just codify that
private tags which shan't be fetched (unless requested explicitly) start
with a dot (/^\./) and we are all set...?
