AFAIK, Cogito introduced it, and Git used it in the wrong way. All files
in .git/branches map 1:1 to a local head (perhaps not really existing).
Git misused this information by using a head name as shortcut for a
remote repository - which still leads to quite some confusion:
In repositories cloned by Cogito you now have a "origin" head, and
automatically have a repository shortcut "origin", too. The same name is
used for different kinds of objects - IMHO quite bad.

The best thing is to simply remove .git/branches parsing in git at all.

I think that putting .git/remotes info into .git/config is nice.
And I also think that putting .git/branches info into .git/config is a nice
thing.
If .git/branches/origin contains "http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git#todo",
this should map to

[head.origin]
  fetchurl = http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
  fetchhead = todo

The problem here is that heads can have spaces, "." and "/" in their name.

Cogito does not have per-repository configuration (e.g. like this "shortcut"
thing), but only about per-head configuration. In this way, the information
in .git/branches is quite different from the one in .git/remotes.
