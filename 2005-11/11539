  Hello,

  I've just noticed that host:remote syntax seems to have been hijacked
again and is now attached to the GIT protocol in

	Documentation/pull-fetch-param.txt

(which BTW misses git+ssh). I said "seems", because connect.c still
appears to assume it is SSH. So what is the plan? One possible
explanation is just that the git+ssh line should have been between the
git line and the : line in the documentation.

  But if you really intend to change it, please don't. It's enough mess
as it is now, and I'm actually not convinced at all that we should
support it at all (god forbid promote it). When you have a location
specifier, you don't want it to randomly switch protocols, especially
such significantly different ones as ssh and git.
