I was planning to keep it in .git (instead of .git/refs/...), because it's 
information about the working tree, not properly part of the repository. 
It's like MERGE_HEAD in being about what the user is in the middle of.

I actually have a bit of a patch now, which only updates checkout and 
commit (anything that updates HEAD should also update CHECKED_OUT, and 
some things probably ought to read CHECKED_OUT instead of HEAD), but 
should serve to give an idea of what I mean. Essentially, if somebody's 
messed with your HEAD, than "git checkout" will update to that, and "git 
commit" will give an error message until you do (I added a check so it 
happens before you write a message, but the third argument to 
"git-update-ref HEAD" would also complain).

Obviously, not for application, since it breaks things like "git resolve" 
which are supposed to change what your working tree contains and aren't 
updated to make CHECKED_OUT match.

---

Keep a private copy of the commit whose tree corresponds to the
git-provided state of the working tree, in case somebody changes the
branch we're on behind our backs.
