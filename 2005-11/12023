Personally I think it would be nice if you could do an augmented 
patchset so that the end result is the same (with the same SHA1 IDs) as 
if one had merged a pull, while still being a human-readable patchset. 
The advantage with that is that once merged it'll do the right thing on 
the author's end.  I think that's pretty much my answer to Jeff's 
question :)
