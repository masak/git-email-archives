The three way merge is still possible even if someone hand edits the
patch.  For a three way merge, you just need to know the parent revision
of the change you want to merge.  parent can mean the revision in the
repository that precedes this patch (mq stores this information, just
not in the patch), or it can mean any revision where the patch applies
cleanly.

Both approaches (mq vs stgit) have advantages...you can get roughly the same
functionality either way.
