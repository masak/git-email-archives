Are you sure you are git hacker? Maybe you should have been fiction

I do not know if ii or iii is better, but please *do* record what
patches were applied at what moment. That is useful info. "I'd like to
go back to know working configuration". If I do not know what patches
were applied at what moment, going back to working config is hard to
do.
