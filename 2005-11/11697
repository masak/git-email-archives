  Hi,

Dear diary, on Sat, Nov 12, 2005 at 09:34:57PM CET, I got a letter
where Fredrik Kuivinen <freku045@student.liu.se> said that...

  I find this part somewhat unclear. So how does the user pick which of
the two different resolution she wants if we will not ask the user to
resolve any conflicts?
