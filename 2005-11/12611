No, you're not using the list form for pipes.  I use that in
git-graft-ripple:

	open(P,"-|","git-rev-list","--parents","--merge-order",$range)

For the kernel, requiring 5.8 shouldn't be a big issue. I suspect it's
really only the commercial Unixes where requiring 5.8 would be annoying.

Randal, is my guess even remotely accurate?
