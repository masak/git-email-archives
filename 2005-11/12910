But CHECKED_OUT isn't a branch. The whole point of it is that you stay on 
some real branch, so you can actually use the tools to affect the 
repository (i.e., the things under refs/). The reason to keep CHECKED_OUT 
is so that you can tell if the branch you're on changes out from under 
you.

For example, I want to have a repository where I push into the 
"production" branch, and I want to be able to get these changes in the 
working tree that the repository is in. If I have HEAD point to 
refs/heads/production, git doesn't know any more what's in the working 
tree, so it can't do the two-way merge. If I have HEAD point to 
CHECKED_OUT, git doesn't know any more what I want to get, so it can't do 
the two-way merge. That is, what I want to have work is:

  server$ git checkout production
  work$ git push server:production
  server$ git checkout

and this should leave the working tree on server with the changes pushed 
from work. Currently, I have to make sure server *isn't* tracking the 
branch I care about when the push happens, so that it doesn't lose track 
of its state, and then switch to the branch to get the changes, and copy 
the branch to a new branch, and switch to that so the next branch won't 
mess up the state.

HEAD is a symbolic ref to the ref in the repository that is the current 
branch. CHECKED_OUT is a ref to the hash that's in the working tree. 
Usually they match, because usually nothing is changing current branch 
without changing the working tree (or making the current branch match 
changes in the working tree), but the point of the patch is to respond 
sensibly to cases where this stops being true, because those can actually 
be part of desirable usage patterns.
