Git doesn't have any textual representations anywhere.

So the _only_ problem should be "git diff" (and related patch-based tools 
- git-apply etc). They'll simply not work. For similar reasons, a 
three-way merge will obviously fail.

Yes. I don't think it's been heavily tested, but the very architecture of 
git should mean that there just shouldn't be any issues with binary files 
outside of the obvious ones.

The only binary file the kernel ever uses is the logo.gif thing, so it's 
been "tested" in the sense that binary files exist, but there's never been 
any changes to that file, so..
