The advantage of cg-init (as opposed git-init-db) is that it finds all the 
files to add.

I just did a quick trial of this, and it appears that git-status does not 
notice deleted or added files.

That is one of the major issues that was worrying me - that I didn't miss any 
of those.  

There is a manual workaround - I have just run up kdiff3 (from kde) on the two 
directories and it is showing 59 file differences (as opposed to the 21 
reported by git-status).  So I could go down them one by one and deal with 
them.

But I was hoping there was an automated method:-(
