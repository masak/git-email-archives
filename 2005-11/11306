Can you run git-http-fetch after the failure to attempt to pick up where
it left off?  It should fail right away, and hopefully contain less
confusing output from parallel requests.

Was there a request header for pack-9cbe...d3a5.pack earlier in the
output, and were there response headers for successful or failed
requests?

FWIW, I've tried cloning that repository a few times and haven't seen
the problem yet.
