Hi,

I just had a crazy idea. Since we have a framework in place to read/write 
.git/config, I thought that maybe it would be a nice thing to move the 
information which is in .git/branches or .git/remotes into the config.

Advantages:

- it would be easy to copy your private configuration by copying just one 
  file,

- it would be easy to add a switch to git-fetch/git-pull to actually
  store/update the URL and head mapping under a certain nick,

- we could get rid of some parsing code, and

- it would arguably be more consistent.

Disadvantage:

- I know, I know, yet another change to the location of this 
  information...

- (very lame) you could not find out which nicks you have stored with "ls"

Comments?

Ciao,
Dscho

P.S.: I did not yet say anything about .git/info/, did I?
