indeed.  this is one area where StGIT is "not safe" to use with other 
porcelains.  these raw GIT commands can show a bunch of confusing 
"dangling references" type errors, or actually modify the index in ways 
that eliminate StGIT-related commits that aren't currently attached to 
any ancestry.  (i think Catalin mentioned these are related to the 
unapplied patches in a stack, but there could be others; see below).

that could be an extremely large number of commits on a large repository 
with a lot of patches that have been worked on over a long period.  so 
whatever mechanism is created to do this needs to scale well in the 
number of commits.

yup.  been there, done that.  lucky for me i have an excellent hourly 
backup scheme.

ah!

actually, those commits aren't all that "temporary".  the 
history/revision feature i'm working on would like to maintain all the 
commits ever done to an StGIT patch.

the only time you can throw away such commits is when the patch is 
deleted or when it is finally committed to the repository via "stg 
commit".  otherwise, keeping these commits in a pack would be quite a 
good thing.

maybe the first thing to do is to get a basic understanding of an StGIT 
commit's lifetime.
