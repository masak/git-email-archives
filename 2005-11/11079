This is the same as before.  It lists the modified files, but it doesn't tell 
you about any added or deleted files.

[I have done this manually now - originally I thought that there were quite a 
few files - but once I had stripped out things like "tags" and some spurious 
directories that were empty it ended up being only three files:-).  So its 
only an intellectual exercise now:-)]
