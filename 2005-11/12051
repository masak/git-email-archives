FWIW, I rarely blame people for bad code; *everyone* does something 
stupid every now and then, and for most of us, far more often than that. 
  "This piece of code is stupid" != "the author of this piece of code is 
stupid", a distinction which unfortunately often gets lost.

I say "rarely", because there are of course a small number of people who 
*consistently* produce crap.  However, even they occationally produce 
something useful -- it's just not that often, and one has to carefully 
review it first.  With sufficient thrust pigs fly just fine[*], and 
heck, even RBJ even occationally says something correct.

[*] It is, however, not necessarily a good idea.  It can be dangerous 
for the people on the ground, and annoys the pig.
