Hi all,

   I need to check as fast as possible if two given trees (sha1 and sha2) have the same files.

What I use now is:

git-diff-tree -r --name-status sha1 sha2

An then I parse the output for 'A' or 'D' as first char of each line. When I found one of that two
chars I kwnow trees have different files set.

The problem is that if sha1 and sha2 correspond to very "distant" revision the output of
git-diff-tree can be very long and also usless as long as I stop searching at first match.

My question is if there is a better way, with the constrain of _not_ use a pipe of commands
like git-diff-tree....| grep something.

The constrain belong from Qt process class that is not very friendly with shells.

Thanks for any help
Marco
