I am of the opinion that nesting is bad because some patches get a few 
comments while some others get them in droves. It's easy to miss those 
with few if they're all nested. As for finding them, all the threads 
should show up next to each other since there's practically no delay 
between sending them.

As for implementation, I don't think most "mail" programs have the 
functionality necessary to do so (dunno though since I didn't investigate).

I thought about that, but decided against it.
