Well, quite frankly, I think the whole graft-rippling is just wrong (why 
do it? The grafts are fine, and after you've rippled, you'll never be able 
to merge with somebody who didn't) but if you do it, I think you should 
fix it up properly and have a resulting tree that is at least as good as 
the original.
