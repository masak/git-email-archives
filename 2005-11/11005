yes, it is expected. However, I just think with a fake parent like what 
.git/info/grafts could provide may solve the issue. At least it make 
git-log be happy to show the only log message in the shallow repository 
without any error.
The rest of problem is gitk could not show any item like what git-log shown.

I am not sure is it right to have a pair of same ID into 
.git/info/grafts or it should be solved by a little patch to gitk.
