Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 03, 2005 at 09:02:10AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

I'm confused now - if the tree is sparse, how does git-read-tree -m know
that the missing files from the other tree are not deletes?

At this point I get nervous since there is a potential for data loss
when something goes wrong at this point (e.g. system crash). I'm not
saying there are no places like that in Cogito now, but I generally
try to avoid them whenever possible.

But if they don't match, you'll get superfluous blobs for the original
index versions which are almost certain to go away.
