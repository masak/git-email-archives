As "Merging two branches" section in Documentation/tutorial.txt
shows, it is one of the valid outcome from merge to leave
conflicts and have you manually resolve.  So this process
probably is working correctly for you this time as well.

Sorry, but I am not a good enough cryptoanalyst to reverse SHA1
hashes, and I cannot tell if the merge you did *should* have
resulted in the conflict or not, just by looking at the three
commit object IDs.

What does "git diff" and "git diff HEAD" tell you after the
merge procedure leaves conflict in the working tree (branchB
directory, I mean)?
