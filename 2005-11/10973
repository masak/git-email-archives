I think showing things the Pasky way may be the easiest to
understand for this particular case and for the simplest case.
The original one would become something like this:

copy Graphics/{PaletteGroups.cs => PaletteCategories.cs} (80%)
copy Graphics/PaletteGroups.cs => Plot/Dialogs/Dialog.cs (75%)
...
copy Graphics/PaletteGroups.cs => Runtime/Scripting/Script.cs (75%)
copy Graphics/PaletteGroups.cs => Runtime/Scripting/ScriptLibrary.cs (64%)
delete Graphics/PaletteGroups.cs

That is, if you are interested in Plot/Dialogs/Dialog.cs, you
know where it came from.  If you are interested in
Graphics/PaletteGroups.cs, you can tell it disappeared.

That is, you need to look at only one line to know what funny
things happened to one path.

However, I suspect that this requires moderate amount of surgery
on the diff output routine (the last stage).  I have a feeling
that git-apply may also need to be told about it when applying
such a patch.

The biggest drawback doing things the Pasky way would be that
the textual diff would need to contain the whole file removal of
Graphics/PaletteGroups.cs.  Do we want to bloat the output for
this?  I personally do not think it is worth it.

We could cheat by only changing the git-apply --summary side, to
implement either Pasky or Daniel proposal, but that would make
output from 'git-diff -p | git-apply --summary' and 'git-diff -r
--name-status -r' inconsistent, which I'd rather avoid.

I think all three (i.e. current, Pasky, Daniel) logically make
sense, and it is to a certain degree just a matter of personal
taste.  Let's try doing nothing for now and see if people get
used to it ;-).
