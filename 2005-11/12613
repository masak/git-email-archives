That's to avoid pruning them but you might not always want to add them
to a pack.

My initial idea was to throw the old commit away once a patch is
refreshed. Even if you want to preserve the history, it would be only
preserved until you send the patch to be merged upstream and you would
delete it locally. If all the patches are meant to be sent upstream at
some point, you can avoid packing them.
