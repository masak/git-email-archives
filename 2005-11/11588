Yes.
But for the conrete implementation it is relevant.

AFAIK, there is not really a "new" and "old" style, but more the
git way (attributes for remote repositories in .git/remotes) and the
Cogito way (attributes for a remote branch).

"Recording" talks about storing the name of the remote branch that
maps to the local "origin" branch, so I would vote for storing this
in .git/branches/origin.

For cg-clone, this is no problem because cg-clone writes this file itself.
Another thing is if you add later on a remote branch with cg-branch-add
without specifying a concrete remote branch name. Do we want the
record the branch name at the first cg-fetch for the future?

Agree.
