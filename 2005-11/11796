It will tell you about its -d and -D options.

I get a feeling there's a higher-level question behind this one, like 
"How can I get a diff between an updated (but not committed) index and 
the files in the working directory?"

When you have a problem it's usually better to just tell people what 
sort of end-result you're hoping to achieve and what steps you've taken 
to accomplish it so far. Asking for details about something that might 
be wrong thinking from the start won't help you but will still require 
much of our time to answer. I.e. nobody gains anything but the work 
still has to be done.

Incidentally, the answer to the quoted question above is (usually)
	git diff-index -p HEAD

Otherwise;
man git (and look in the "IDENTIFIER TERMINOLOGY". I wish I had).

and

for i in /usr/bin/git-*tree*; do man ${i##*/}; done
