Yes it should. Currently the git makefile doesn't distinguish between 
CFLAGS and LDFLAGS which results in a fair few warnings.

gitk is in tcl so I'd be surprised if that didn't work.

I don't think there's been a whole lot of testing for other shells but 
the friendly folks on this list usually takes care of fixing such things
