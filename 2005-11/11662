Welcome and good stuff! I'll give your patches a try when I sober up.
In the meantime, some notes after having read the patches a bit...

These bug/sanity fixes are _good_. As you mention, I wasn't aware that
patchnames could show up not having a --branch part. Tricky...

Hmmm. I understand what you are doing, but I'm not sure we'd want to
replace the current code with this strategy.  Importing large trees
with hundreds (thousands) of commits is so slow it is just a no go.
Renames are described quite well in the 'commit log', and the current
code does handle file renames...

Can you elaborate a bit more on this?

Yes, this got fixed recently. Your change here goes together with the
'tla get' + rsync strategy which I'm not sure about.

Fair enough. Does it result on a good graft in git?

Those two are interesting!

That's excellent -- thanks!

Fair enough. You mention an alternative strategy (tla ancestry) --
have you tried it at all?

cheers,
