Dear diary, on Sun, Nov 06, 2005 at 10:11:10AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

The problem is that at least Cogito defaults to the 'origin' branch when
pulling/merging, so if you'll have 'origin/master' instead of 'origin',
I will have to hack that around. So it's not _just_ a convention but
something reflected in some code as well.

This loses the pretty nice property that 'origin' refers to the HEAD
branch of the remote repository, no matter how is it called (well, it is
nice as long as the remote repository doesn't _switch_ the HEAD to some
non-superset branch; but repositories you're cloning from shouldn't do
that). So you should either have origin/HEAD locally, or make the
'master' branch more "socially canonical".

What would it be useful for?
