Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 10, 2005 at 12:36:44AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...

I'm not arguing against mergeFile but rather git-merge-one-file (and by
implication cg-Xmergefile), actually. My point is - couldn't be
mergeFile generalized a bit or padded with suitable interface to be
usable as git-merge-one-file's drop-in replacement?

I'm not sure I follow you here - what exactly does not feel disturbing
and what good reasons are there for whatever they are? :-)
