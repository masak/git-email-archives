Eric,

thanks for resending those so quickly. I think I'm going to sit on the
'overhaul of changeset application' patch a bit -- I'll test & ack
your other patches for merge soonish but I want to review and test
this one carefully.

My main concern is that it seems to be calling tla get for each
revision that it imports. For large trees, this is slow. I would be
much happier with a fast Perl-based approach. Have you got a public
repo with directory renames?

Additional comments follow...

Yup, makes sense. My concern now is that existing imports will change
the name of branches and tags going forward. Can I ask you to resend
that patch with the new branchname mangling as default, and the old
one as optional?

I know it'll force us to go back to using shellquote, but I am not too
worried by that dependency at the moment.

Also interested in this if you get around to it.

cheers,
