Sane point. This doesn't work without a ./configure script or some such 
though (something external to the Makefile that updates a config-file of 
some sort), as

make
(make finishes, user remembers he/she must use prefix= to install somewhere)
make prefix=/usr

wouldn't rebuild git so binaries produced would still try to use 
$HOME/bin for libdir. Granted, it's easy enough to do 'touch git.c' 
before rebuilding, but it's not exactly intuitive.

I'll hack up a configure-script if that's alright. It should be fairly 
short and just define the GIT_VERSION and GIT_LIBDIR macros.

I imagine this can be done through the config.mak file, included from 
221 in Makefile, supposing it's forcibly included rather than just if it 
exists, and we'll have the 'git:' target depend on it. I think this is 
the least intrusive change. OTOH, it might not be bad to move some of 
the uname_? logic to a shell-script (and have all targets depend on 
config.mak).

Thoughts? I've got a feeling I've overlooked something here.
