You're right, we need to keep the "-r" behaviour.

If you take my last patch and make "ls_flags" default to 0 again, it 
should work correctly.

The way to traverse into directories (a la qgit/webgit) is to just give 
the SHA1 name of the directory. Ie

	git-ls-tree HEAD

gives us a single level, we see:

	...
	040000 tree b2d1264f85148d18c5ae9864d73d65737b0a1734    t
	...

and then we can just do

	git-ls-tree b2d1264f85148d18c5ae9864d73d65737b0a1734

to get that level. I assume that that is what qgit/webgit already does (I 
sure hope so, otherwise they're just wasting time, making the tools 
re-parse the trees over and over again for no gain).
