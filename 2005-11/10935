The patches need to be chained so a top patch would also refer to the
previously applied patches since they are its base. Anyway, I don't
like adding too many files to the refs/heads directory.

The refresh -n should be the default and maybe just specifying an
option when you want to add a comment to that commit. But, by mutating
the temporary commit, wouldn't this mean that you lose the refresh
history?
