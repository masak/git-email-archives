I just posted a patch to prevent another alternate request from starting
if one is already in progress.

This should not be an issue with index requests because they are only
initiated from fetch().  The previous patch to load alternates on demand
added alternate handling to process_curl_messages() so that a 404 for an
object can be handled immediately rather than waiting for the fetch()
call for that object to notice.
