Exactly what I want.

Thanks,

P.S. I figured this one out in three stages:
Since checked out files are in rw- mode, but unchecked
files simply do not exist, first I want to "revert"
a changed file in the working tree -- this one is easy.
Then the second stage is if also the index is updated
(but no commit), and the last stage is if also
there is a commit, for which I think I know what to use.
