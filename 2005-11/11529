Dear diary, on Fri, Nov 11, 2005 at 12:56:54AM CET, I got a letter
where Josef Weidendorfer <Josef.Weidendorfer@gmx.de> said that...

Yes, that's a valid point, but I still think for the usual case
defaulting to HEAD is the right thing to do. But it wasn't described
in the documentation and that's indeed a bug - fixed now.

Yes, this is the recommended workflow. Well, if you plan to switch
branches randomly in your "central private repository", better explicitly
specify #master in the offsprings. ;-)
