Well, then, you should get rid of cogito/Documentation/introduction.html,
if you don't plan on supporting the interfaces described there.

I'm really just starting out. I see that tutorial, and I want to do it.

Ugh, ugh ugh ugh.

I can't, because I have to do the first push.  This is what I was told
last time!

I'm doing what I'm told, and now more things are breaking.  This is
frustrating.

I'm not saying that you guys aren't doing a hell of a job.  I'm just
coming at this from a user's perspective, and trying to describe it to
others.  I'm not comfortable yet, because every time I try to do what
the manuals say, it breaks.  Perhaps y'all are secretly working around
every broken thing, but I don't know enough to do that.

Junio> fine; I do that as a cheap backup on my local machine.

So, give me the exact steps, using "cg" to:

        create a "remote" repo on my disk
        create a "local" repo on my disk
        set up the linkage between remote and local
        push from local to remote
        pull from remote to local

And if it ever needs a command like "cat" or "echo", something is
wrong.  I'll accept a "git-" command for one or two of the steps, but
that feels like dropping into assembler instead of C.
