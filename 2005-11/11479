I agree with Pavel here :-)

That's probably the simplest.

It happens to me to keep some patches popped which aren't really part
of the stack (i.e. splitting a big patch, I still keep it in the
unapplied patches to push it later and check what was left after
splitting). From this point of view, (ii) would be better but with the
drawback that you need to have a valid stack with all the patches
pushed.

(iii) is the most comprehensive method and, as Pavel said, we should
record what patches were applied or not and reproduce them exactly
when retrieving a different state.

Another big problem is the base of the stack, which can change. Would
retrieving an old state of the stack also restore the old the base? I
think it should and its up to the user to rebase it.

A simple way to partially achieve (iii) is to extend the existing
'branch' command to clone the whole series into a new one, including
all the patches. The problem with this approach is that there is no
temporal relation between branches.

How would you expect to switch between different states of the stack?
As Chris Mason mentioned, once you start doing this people might ask
for full SCM features (like diffs between revisions) where the objects
are stack states. This would complicate StGIT quite a lot.
