I don't like having lots of junk installed. Besides, I do a lot of 
development work for the Openwall distro which tries fairly hard to get 
away without installing lots of cruft. I'd rather not taint it with 
packages from other vendors since I do a fair amount of RPM building and 
testing on it but I still want to be able to use git on it.

By "local" do you mean "local on Junio's laptop" or "local at cox.net"?

"mail" uses the "local on Junio's laptop" SMTP server so he can 
configure it any way he wants.
