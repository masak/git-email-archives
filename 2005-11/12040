curl and curl-devel. Or you can build with

	make NO_CURL=YesPlease

which just means you won't have http and https transports available. 
This shouldn't be much of a problem on a server though.

I have no idea, but since it's a developer tool in pre-1.0 I think the 
general consensus is that user-friendliness in the build-process comes 
somewhere between "not so important" and "what? users? oh, those living 
in the *other* land!"

Perhaps you should try the RPM's at 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git-core/ ?

If nothing else it will tell you what other packages you need.
