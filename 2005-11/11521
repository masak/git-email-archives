Yes. I was quite astonished when I noticed first, thinking the shell 
kept the parsed script in cache or some such. Apparently it doesn't.

Someone said libexec was moving out (of Linux, at least), so I thought 
I'd better avoid that. Perhaps GIT_LIBDIR?

Btw, I re-visited ye ole "git binary directory?" thread and noticed the 
nifty trick you did with PATH from the wrapper. I'll add that to git.c 
and, unless I get a better suggestion, rename GIT_LIB to GIT_LIBDIR (and 
git --libdir).

It's not just you, but GIT_DIR was taken and I felt lazy.
