Yes, I agree with you and Junio, a workaround like let the user to choose the code page 
in the viewer is more then enough.

And also in this case, a choice between the local codec and utf-8 should take almost 
all cases.

Because of this, I added a text codec selector in qgit, reachable from settings menu.

There is a new release, qgit-0.97.2, with this new feature and some good
annotate fixes.

For the people interested the page with all the links is:

P.S: Now I can finally see Junio japanese name ;-)
