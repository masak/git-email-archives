Seems like it might make sense to handle pack downloads immediately when
an object is unavailable rather than waiting for the fetch() call.  It
could prevent attempts to download any other objects inside that pack,
although queued requests that activate while a pack is downloading
would have to wait to see whether the download is successful.  If such
an object also exists loose it would prevent a redundant download and if
not it would at least prevent an unnecessary check and 404.

Thoughts?
