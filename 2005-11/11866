It is _easy_. I've setup a server for git-related paraphernalia at
work already ;)

The URL is:
  http://locke.catalyst.net.nz/git/git-martinlanghoff.git/#tojunio

gitweb at:
  http://locke.catalyst.net.nz/gitweb?p=git-martinlanghoff.git;a=summary

That gitweb has per-branch RSS feeds, if you are an rss junkio ;-) you
can just subscribe to it...

A word of warning, though: those branches rewind/rebase often, and I
won't apologise about it. You should be able to just delete your
'martinlanghoff' head and refetch it. Anyone else reading this... just
_don't_ base your work on my branch as it's bound to break.

:-)

/me is happy that you've forgotten about my brown-paper-bag patch with
a random character in the middle!

Fine w me -- TIMTOWDI. I do understand, however, your interest in
having full paths in the usage line to make debugging easier. Whatever
is consistent with the project in general.

cheers,
