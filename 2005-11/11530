Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 10, 2005 at 02:51:57PM CET, I got a letter
where "Randal L. Schwartz" <merlyn@stonehenge.com> said that...

You should do what you did - it was just a warning. git-clone seems to
have created only a 'remotes' entry, which Cogito doesn't understand
(yet).

> By the way, my "make only if something changed" works now, because

Any reason why you were unable to tell the main make 'doc install-doc'?
