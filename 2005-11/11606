Dear diary, on Fri, Nov 11, 2005 at 05:31:31PM CET, I got a letter
where Paolo Teti <paolo.teti@gmail.com> said that...

Can you be a bit more detailed in the description of what do you exactly
want?

Do you want to lock the file so that noone else will be able to check it
out? That's impossible from GIT's very nature of distributed version
control system.

Do you want to lock the file in your working copy so that you won't be
able to remove it or change it? In that case, this is possible, but not
implemented yet. Part of the solution would involve making the file
read-only, the rest would be probably to make sure all the tools handle
that case gracefully.
