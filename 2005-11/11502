Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 10, 2005 at 05:41:10AM CET, I got a letter

Wow, astonishingly simple.

But obviously now the trouble is opposite, when the files are completely
unrelated, since now you likely get large conflicting areas interleaved
with some scarce common lines... And this might get to be a big PITA to
resolve as well.

That said, I still really like --no-add and it would be heart-wrenching
to just coldly dismiss it. It is a great tool, but I would let the user
to use it manually. Possibly something like

	git-twofile-merge foo~1 foo~2

(the name is stupid, obviously) or a button in some GUI tool.
