We do like this;

core
core/gui
core/lib

$ cat .gitignore
gui
lib

This is also nice because it lets the gui maintainers have the gui as 
the root with the core and lib parts as subdirectories. Everyone has 
their own responsibility checked out at top-level with other pieces 
below it. It's easy enough to script a pull of all repos so everyone's 
up to sync and everybody's happy.

It would certainly be nicer to have git ignore directories that have the 
".git" directory (so long as it's not the top of the repo, that is), but 
I haven't had the energy to fix that when there's already a solution 
that's simple enough and quite adequate.
