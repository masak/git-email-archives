The reason the old pack is kept instead of the new one is that it
is a proper superset of the new one. 

The "git-repack -a -d" case is fixed in Junios master, and I have sent out
a patch which lets you pipe git-fsck-objects --full --unreachable to
git-pack-redundant in the other cases, so the problem should hopefully
be resolved shortly.
