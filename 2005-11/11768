On a large tree I had an impression that applying patch and then
falling back on 3-way is faster, but other than that, nothing,
really.  Just being able to use a single mechanism, which does
not buy us much.

I'd rather not see our "patch" go in the direction of recording
both pre- and post-image of blob for binary files, which is what
we would end up doing if we really want to do binary flexibly.

Well, that may be nice as an option, but not by default.

An option halfway in between would be to record the pre-image
SHA1 and post- blob, perhaps compressed-uuencoded.  This would
limit us to the case that the recipient has not touched the
binary file and replacing it, but in practice that might be
enough.

I'm willing to do the C hackery myself if there is enough
interest in it.
