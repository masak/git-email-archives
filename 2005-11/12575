And than, do you have to announce a special procedure everyone's is to
execute after a clone so all subrepos are cloned? How do you handle
common configs and clone options in subrepos? It also would be nice to
have branches visible not only in in subrepos but in top-repo as well,
and the other way around.

I'm also wondering, what implications core/lib/.git/{config,remotes/,refs/}
under control in core/ can have?..

BTW, will something like "*/.git/*" in info/exclude work? IOW, does *
match a "/"?
