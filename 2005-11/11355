The problem is in the multiple-common-ancestors case. If we have three
common ancestors, A, B and C, we will start with merging A with B. The
result is a new 'virtual' commit object (not stored in the object
database), lets call it V. We are then going to merge V with C. To do
that we need to get the common ancestor(s) of V and C, and as V
doesn't exist in the database we can't use git-merge-base.

I haven't given it a lot of thought though, it might be possible to
use git-merge-base in some way and get the same results as we get now.

It would certainly be possible to use git-merge-base in the first
iteration and use the python code only when we actually have any
'virtual' commit objects.
