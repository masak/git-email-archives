Well, it's extremely expensive most of the time. It's often as expensive 
as the packing itself. So I don't like that option very much.

Actually, some dim memories prodded me to some man-page digging, and the 
"pipefail" option in particular.

It seems to be a common option to both ksh and bash, so

	set -o pipefail

seems like it should fix this. Sadly, I think it's pretty recent in bash 
(ksh apparently got it in -93, bash seems to have gotten it only as of 
version 3.0, which is definitely recent enough that we can't just assume 
it).

[ Also, bash seems to have a variable called $PIPESTATUS, but that's 
  bash-specific (I don't know when it was enabled). ]

Anyway, doing a

	set -o pipefail

should never be the wrong thing to do, but the problem is figuring out 
whether the option is available or not, since if it isn't available, it's 
considered an error ;/

So with all that, how about we take your "Gaah" idea, and simplify it: 
just pipe stderr too. That, together with making git-pack-objects tell 
what garbage it got, actually does the rigth thing:

	[torvalds@g5 git-clone]$ git repack -a -d
	fatal: expected sha1, got garbage:
	 error: Could not read 7f59dbbb8f8d479c1d31453eac06ec765436a780

with this pretty simple patch.

Whaddaya think?
