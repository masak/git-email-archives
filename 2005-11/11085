Another way to do this would be using the ~/.ssh/config file.  It would
look something like this:

Host host
  ProxyCommand ...

Or, more generically...

Host *.*
  ProxyCommand ...

Host *.* assumes that if the machine name has a '.' in it then you are
trying to get outside the firewall.  This might not be a good assumption
but it works well where I am.

Then use host:pathname or ssh://host/pathname or whatever.

The advantage of using this is that it works for anything that uses ssh
to get outside the firewall.  Not just git.  So, setup is minimal.
