I don't know what gitk is.

This shows tags on the bottom half of this page, with the last few commits in 
the top half:

http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux%2Fkernel%2Fgit%2Ftorvalds%2Flinux-2.6.git;a=summary

If I click on the "..." under shortlog, I get to see a full page of commits, 
which does (currently) include the -rc2 tag.

My use case is I want to see what commits have gone in since the last tarball 
I downloaded.  (Waiting for various patches to be merged, etc.)  The tag 
indicates the last intentionally released (and thus minimally tested) 
tarball, so it would be nice if the tag's entry was visually distinct in the 
big list.
