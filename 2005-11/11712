  Hello,

  I'm announcing the release of Cogito version 0.16rc2, the human-friendly
version control UI for Linus' GIT tool. Share and enjoy at:

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/

  Compared to rc1, this carries few bugfixes, a minor feature or two,
some small documentation updates, extended testsuites etc.

  The new stuff includes:

  * Curl is used instead of wget for HTTP heads fetching
  * Handle multiple merge bases (leaving the decision on the user)
  * cg-init -m'msg' support

  * Fix a long-standing bug with some stale files not being removed
    during large fast-forwards
  * Non-symlink HEADs are now fetched from properly
  * cg-commit -f now really works
  * Local fetching should work even without GNU cp now
  * Some fetch progressbar fixes

  * Few tiny improvements
  * Several new tests
  * Small documentation updates

  If I will get no more bugreports during the next few days, this will
become 0.16 final.

  Happy hacking,

--
