At this point, we could have a "git-merged-by-hand" script that would take 
filenames, check that they're unmerged now, and, if so, call 
git-update-index for them. And it could have a -a to do all of the 
unmerged entries (i.e., "I'm done merging by hand"), and maybe also have a 
flag to git-commit that does this, so you can say, "Commit the merge I did 
by hand, whatever filenames it used, but not any other changes I may have 
had beforehand."

The "merged-by-hand" script would probably be a sensible place to complain 
about leftover conflict markers (unless you force it).
