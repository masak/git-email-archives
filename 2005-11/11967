Argh. This is pretty horrible way to turn a path into an absolute one. 
Especially since you didn't even test whether the original "wd" was 
successful.

Why don't you just do

	if (exec_path[0] != '/') {
		.. prepend "cwd/" to exec_path ..

since as far as I can tell you don't actually care whether it's a 
simplified path or not (you can remove "./" at the beginning just to make 
it cleaner, if you wish. In fact, you can remove "../" at the beginning 
too (but only the beginning) since getcwd() shouldn't have any symlink 
components).

The reason to avoid "chdir(relative) + chdir(back)" is that it totally 
unnecessarily breaks under some extreme cases. For example, if the 
exec_path is already absolute, and we just happen to be in a really deep 
subdirectory, then the getcwd() could have failed due to the PATH_MAX 
limitations.

Also, depending on getcwd() will not work if any parent directory is 
unreadable or non-executable (well, under Linux it will, as long as it's 
executable, since getcwd() is actually a system call. Not in UNIX in 
general, though). Again, that means that unless you _have_ to know what 
the cwd is, you should try to avoid relying on it.

Now, there are Linux-specific tricks that can avoid some of the problems 
if you want to, but they are very much hacks:

	if (filename[0] != '/') {
		fd = open(filename, O_DIRECTORY);
		if (fd >= 0) {
			snprintf(link_name, sizeof(link_name), "/proc/self/fd/%d", fd);
			if (!readlink(link_name ...)) {
				.. there it is ..
			}
			close(fd);
		}
	..

and the nicer thign to do is to just not try to be clever.
