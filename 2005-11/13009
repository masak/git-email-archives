Sorry, I was not clear about it when I did that table the first
time.  2ALT was "alternatives suggested to replace 2" and listed
in the same table for comparison purpose.

The original table was designed in a way that if you have a
match on case N, there would not be any other case M that matches
the case, either N<M or M<N.  IOW, the order to read the table
did not matter.  At least that was the intention.

If you read "missing" = 0, "exists" = 1, and take OAB as bit2,
bit1, and bit0, you can easily see the pattern in the table.  It
counts in binary, although bit1 has various subcases so the
table has more than 8 rows, and it is easy to see it covers all.

That is good.

... which was a good thing to think about in itself.  I feel I
understand the new table a bit better.
