Ok.  Whew, I'm glad to report that I was mistaken.  git-cvsimport
performs beautifully when given the new CVSps output.  Sorry for the
noise.

I'll change this then to an announcement that with that CVSps patch,
CVSps produces more accurate branch ancestry, and git-cvsimport can
correctly reproduce branch-of-a-branch histories.

On a related note, the new '-P' option doesn't behave exactly as I
expected.  You must provide the _full_ pathname to the input file
CVSps file.  If that's not a bug, it should at least be documented.
