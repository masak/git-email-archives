Yes.

But I imagined a programmer new to git. And then I looked at the situation 
I had yesterday after pulling to 97fc6c5f.. in which I was able to build 
just fine, but calls like "git diff" no longer worked.

Now, *I* know what I have to put into config.mak, but I would hate the 
project if I was new to it, tried to play around with it, and nothing 
would work in spite of being compiled with just one warning, thank you.

Just a safety measure for the price of two lines. When I check out a new 
project, I do "make", play around with it, and then do "make install". If 
I had to set "export USE_INPLACE=1", "make install" should barf, because 
the compiled programs are not meant to be used anywhere else.

Having said that, I probably should have called it an RFC, not a PATCH. 
Sorry.

Ciao,
Dscho
