$src/$dst pairs match the arguments given on the command line of git-mv,
And git-mv (as was git-rename) is able to move directory trees around.

It is simplier to keep the granularity at directories, as multiple moves
of directories can not overlap each other. If you do it at file level, you
have to remote and create directories yourself.

Of course, for git it is done at file level (that are the @srcfiles/@dstfiles
arrays), but this is quite trivial as git does not work with directories, but
only with files.

> Should we replace $dst my $destfiles[0] ?

Yes, that was part of my patch.
