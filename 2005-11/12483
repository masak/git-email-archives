Note that I didn't actually mean that they should necessarily represent 
files in .git/.  The point was more that if we wanted to have 
version-controlled metadata, using .git/ as a namespace would be suitable.

In particular, I believe that if we ever do that, git should obtain this 
metadata from the repository/object database.

I fully concur with this (as I pointed out in my post, although perhaps 
fuzzily.)
