DWIM = "Do What I Mean", i.e. program trying to be clever.  A (usually) 
good thing for usability, a very bad thing for security.

In particular, DWIM is bad for security when you have a flow like:

	user input -> security check -> DWIM

... which lets the user subvert the security check by knowing how the 
DWIM will mangle the input.  What's worse, programmers like yourself 
frequently say "oh, it's okay, though, I know what the DWIM does and it 
can't break the security checks I do."

Well, then someone comes along and changes either the security checks 
(e.g. add a blacklist), or the DWIM, or both.  Security hole opens.

Therefore, the flow must *ALWAYS* be:

	user input -> DWIM -> security check


Your patch re-introduces the incorrect flow.
