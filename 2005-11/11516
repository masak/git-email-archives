I am with Andreas here.

If you are using git to manage development in a tightly knitted
group (e.g. company internal project) and are unlikely to be
exchanging email patches, not having to pull Email::Valid into
your system is a good thing, because you would not be using
git-mail.  If you are not dealing with development history
stored in svn or tla, not having to install git-svn nor git-tla
is a good thing.

Technical reasons like package availablity and required package
size count, but I do not think we should be doing the split
purely for technical reasons.  The split should aim primarily
to give convenience for the users.

That reminds me, Andreas, you said something about feeding me
spec updates last week but Jim beated you.  I am open to
improvements from both of you.  Obviously the invitation is not
limited to two of you ;-).
