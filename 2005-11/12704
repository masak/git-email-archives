That really doesn't work very well. I push to that tree often several 
times a day, and you'd have to re-do the cache each time.

So it would be much better if git-pack-objects would just always cache its 
output in .git/pack-cache - along with some logic to just get rid of old 
ones regularly.

Since git-pack-objects has to generate the pack _anyway_, it might as well 
save it away when it does - so that if you have lots of people doing 
clones or pulling, you'd only need to run it once for a particular set of 
objects, and you'd not have to do any extra (or unnecessary) maintenance.
