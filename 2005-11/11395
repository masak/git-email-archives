I have just downloaded git-core-0.99f

On my debian unstable system I can build the documentation just fine

On my debian sarge system it fails almost immediately

alan@roo:Documentation$ make
asciidoc -b xhtml11 -d manpage -f asciidoc.conf git-add.txt
WARNING: non-standard xhtml11 backend
FAILED: incomplete configuration files
make: *** [git-add.html] Error 1
alan@roo:Documentation$        



I've patched up asciidoc as per instructions.

Searching for a package (dpkg -S xhtmll) that uses anything to do with xhtml11 
shows nothing on Sarge, and shows asciidoc (and some other things, like 
quanta and mozilla) on debian unstable.  I assume therefore its just a 
version issue of asciidoc, although I am confused because the note about 
patching asciidoc assumes you had 6.0.3 installed - which is what debian 
sarge has.
