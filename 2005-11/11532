Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 10, 2005 at 05:32:35PM CET, I got a letter
where "Randal L. Schwartz" <merlyn@stonehenge.com> said that...

You should cg-init locally, then cg-admin-setuprepo the public one and
push to it. I updated cg-admin-setuprepo's description wrt. that now.

But this is actually an entirely unrelated bug, it seems - pretty
strange.  I revived another few months old thread because of this, since
it seems the 'b' was actually a typo and we don't want to pass 'cp' this
argument at all, but something different. Does cloning locally otherwise
work?
