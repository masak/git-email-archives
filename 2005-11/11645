You can do it either way.  It's a matter of the strictness of the 
binding.  If you put %{version} there, then it has to come from the same 
upstream release; for %{version}-%{release} it has to come from the same 
SRPM, i.e. usually from the same build.

In this case I think %{version}-%{release} is appropriate.
