You need to have the expat (XML parsing library) header files installed
from something like the "expat development kit".

If you do already have 'expat.h' installed under say /usr/include does
changing "#include "expat.h" to "#include <expat.h>" perhaps help?
Searching for include files specified with #include "..." is somewhat
platform dependant.

Alternatively, if you don't need 'git-http-push' you can define
'NO_EXPAT' and the Makefile will take care that it doesn't get built.

Incidentally 'git whatchanged -p http-push.c' shows that this dependency
on expat and its include header has been there since the first version
on November 2nd. So 'no longer compiles' seems a bit odd!
