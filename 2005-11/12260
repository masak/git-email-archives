In the case of the Linux kernel, UTF-8 of course is the
way to go. As you can not reject already commited objects, the second
option seems the best way.

But I think it would be better to have a config option specifying the
prefered encoding for commit comments in a project. Something like

	core.commit-encoding = Latin-1

gitweb should use this.
