Again I do not think I'd ever use that feature from the original
send-email myself, but the difference is that this CC list
depends on each commit (sign-offs taken from a commit are
added to CC list for only that commit).

Yes, and that could be spelled "git-send-patch ..HEAD" as well,
if we go with my suggestion to default <bottom> to "origin".

Just to make sure you did not misunderstand me, I meant: the
proposed program acts as if <commit>^1..<commit> was given when
single <commit> is given.

But you are right.  We could make a single <commit> a short-hand
for "origin"..<commit>; if somebody wants to pick just one
commit from a topic branch, he can always say <commit>^1..<commit>.

Manymanymanymanymany.  I do all my rebases and cherry-picks via
format-patch piped to git-am, and obviously they are never sent
out.
