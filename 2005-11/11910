I think you should be able to use "git-convert-objects" to do both history 
pruning and history adding.

It would need a bit of work: right now "convert_commit()" parses the 
commit 100% by hand, and doesn't care about the grafts file. But that is 
where such a conversion would be done.

Right now "convert_commit()" actually does the first conversion in-place 
(because the size of the head of the commit never changes), and then calls 
"convert_date()" which will allocate a new buffer and do the conversion 
there - that's for totally stupid hysterical raisins, and it should really 
have allocated the new buffer in convert_commit() - something you'd need 
to do if you end up editing the "parent" information at that point.

So it would take some work, but the infrastructure for doing these kinds 
of conversions is all there.
