Sure. It's private because it has its own name, and you can make _sure_ 
that nobody tries to push to it by having a trigger that refuses to update 
that branch.

Now, if you want to make it also be _invisible_ (so that when others don't 
clone, they don't see what the checked-out state was when they cloned), 
you'd have to make some new rules to git. We could have rules like "branch 
names that start with '.' aren't listed", which would effectively do 
exactly that..
