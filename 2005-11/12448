They are all commits. There is nothing "mixed". Tags usually just point
to a commit.

You mean, you want to see in the list of commits, the ones marked, which
a tag is pointing to? Similar to what gitk is doing?

There is no package for gitweb. Just the single gitweb.cgi file, which is
copied there. You can get the gitweb version in the html source. Just do
"view source" in your browser.
