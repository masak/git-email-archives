Something like

	git diff -R -M -p

should do it, no?

("git diff" has the strange property that if you give it any diff flags at 
all, it forgets all the default ones. So it defaults to "-M -p", but if 
you just say "-R", it will drop its own defaults, and use _just_ "-R").

[ Which is almost certainly not what most users want, but it's practical 
  when you want to get the internal git format. Whether that is important 
  enough to confuse users or not, I dunno ]
