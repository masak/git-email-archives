Well, not anymore about HEAD as far as I can tell...  Maybe in
enter_repo ([PATCH 1/5]) we need to do something like what
setup.c::is_toplevel_directory() does?

I think this list was added relatively recently as a usability
measure.  Maybe we would want an equivalent in enter_repo()?
Under strict-path, I think not doing any DWIM like this is fine,
but otherwise I suspect changing this would break existing
remotes/origin file people may have.  In addition enter_repo()
as posted does its own DWIM to chdir to ".git" unconditionally
as I pointed out...

Needs a bit more thought, but I think otherwise the basic idea
is right.
