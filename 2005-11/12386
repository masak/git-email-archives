Hi,

I like this approach best. In fact, that was my idea on how to go about 
implementing that feature.

However,

I don't like this. Usually, data in ini files is not dependent on its 
position in the file, with the notable exception of section names. I never 
ran across nested sections (probably for all the reasons XML is 
unreadable). And the sections should be exchangable, just for clarities 
sake.

And it _does_ make finding the information for less savvy git users more 
easy.

I'm not 100% convinced, either, but it could be a better concept than 
different files in different places and different formats basically doing 
the same.

But my thinking went like this: if Pasky and Junio can not agree on one 
location and format, and therefore none of the two is deprecated, how 
about giving them a way out they both might be able to agree to?

Ciao,
Dscho

P.S.: Anybody noticed that I did not use 0xb4 in five days?
