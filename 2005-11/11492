I don't agree.  The chance of running git-archimport and not having
arch installed is significantly less likely than the chance of not
noticing that the git-archimport program exists because it was moved
into a separate package that you didn't know you needed to install in
the first place.

The main reason I see for splitting cvs and email import out is the
non-standard dependencies, cvsps and perl(Email::Valid).  While for
svn import it's to keep from requiring subversion-perl of everone who
installs git-core.  This dependency is added automatically, so you
cannot easily just ignore it like you can in the arch/tla case.

There is no need for a separate documentation RPM, since the
documentation is marked as such and rpm has a standard way to avoid
installing them (--excludedocs).
