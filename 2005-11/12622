        -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=link

        --no-dereference
               never follow symbolic links

        --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
               preserve   the   specified   attributes  (default:
               mode,ownership,timestamps) and security contexts,
               if possible
               additional attributes: links, all

I don't know how to get those options with POSIX only cp.

I'm not Junio, but I think the priorities right now are ordererd like 
this; good performance, fast development, portability.

Good performance because it's designed to handle one of the largest open 
projects there is.

Fast development because it's still a young project but has more 
momentum than most projects, open or closed, ever get. If it slows down 
now it will stay slow until the kernel team needs new features and 
there's no way of recycling inertia.

Portability because that's nice but not vital for the project as a whole 
(it's a linuxish tool, so most users run it on linux so far). I think 
portability usually ends up a bit behind in the race because it often 
hinders #1 and #2.

Again, I'm not Junio. I might be dead wrong.

However, most of the plumbing works on just about anything with a CPU, 
so unless you really need cg-clone you should be able to do it with 
git-clone, which AFAIU uses 'tar' and 'cpio' instead of cp to transfer 
files (for portability reasons, I imagine).
