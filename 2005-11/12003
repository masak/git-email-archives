Hmph.  That certainly sounds like what I might do.  Especially
the part "play around before installing", so I am *very*
sympathetic.

OTOH, I do not particularly want to advertise/encourage in-place
use.  Once you built today's git ;-), wouldn't you cd somewhere
else and use it for your real work?  That would mean you have
one location on your PATH that you keep the latest git build
and I am not sure why being able to run in-place is such a big
deal.  Is it because $HOME is under a tight quota?

OK.  That's sensible.
