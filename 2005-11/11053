Documentation/tutorial-script/script.sh can be used as a testsuite.
Errors should cause the script to exit.  Unexpected success should be
treated like an error.  Successful completion should be reported.

Currently, the last cg-merge invocation doesn't fail as it should, and
the subsequent ed scripts fail for Makefile and rpn.c.  I don't have a
fix for that.  Most likely, the script in cogito differs from the
original version.  Horst, could you please have a look?
