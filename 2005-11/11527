Dear diary, on Fri, Nov 11, 2005 at 12:26:18AM CET, I got a letter

In public repositories, you usually set the HEAD once and it stays
there, or when you switch it, you are really careful about it.

See above. The remote HEAD is supposed to be generally stable for public
repositories, pointing to the _default_ head for public consumption.
If you want something specific, specify it by the #branchname.

That this is from 23 August and this change was in Cogito for several
major releases and noone ever complained. ;-)
