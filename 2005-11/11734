We'd be much better off with just saying "we encourage people to use 
utf-8, but if you don't, just set your locale to make things show up 
properly".

utf-8 is clearly the future, and if we make git internally aware of 
locales, that's just going to complicate things. And usually for no good 
reason, since users don't really care that much.

I really hate codepages. I'd much rather say:
 - git is 8-bit clean, so you can use any damn encoding you want
 - utf-8 is strongly recommended for all the same reasons it's recommended 
   for anything else.

Hmm?
