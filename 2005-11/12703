There's room to improve on that particular inefficiency.  The http
commit walker could use Range: headers to fetch loose objects directly
from inside a pack if it didn't make sense to fetch the entire pack.
For this to work, pack fetches would need to be deferred until the
entire tree had been walked, and the commit walker could decide whether
to fetch the pack or loose objects based on the percentage of packed
objects it needed to fetch.  It would also need to fetch all
tag/commit/tree objects using ranges to be able to fully walk the tree.
