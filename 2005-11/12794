Dear diary, on Mon, Nov 21, 2005 at 02:56:41PM CET, I got a letter
where Johannes Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de> said that...
> With this patch, git automatically extracts the information from 
> .git/branches and .git/remotes, puts it into .git/config, and renames the

Please don't do so for .git/branches, that is primarily Cogito thing
and you will make it impossible to use GIT and Cogito on the same
repository - the moment the user uses git-pull on the repository, his
Cogito configuration is trashed and he has even no reliable undo
mechanism.

And in another thread (we have too many threads for this subject ;-)
I've tried to explain that branches and remotes are different concepts,
which live in different namespaces and have different semantics, so
rewriting branches to remotes is a bad idea anyway.
