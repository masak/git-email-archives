I actually had that problem with the original tables; there isn't a 
canonical order in which to list a table of all of the possible matches 
and non-matches between items so as to be complete.

Perhaps it ought to list, on each line, which previous cases would match, 
so that you could see that case 2 is really the conditions of 2 minus the 
conditions for 2ALT, which is "all of the ancestors are empty, the head 
has a directory/file conflict, and remote exists."

It can't fall off the table, because 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 11 cover all 
of the possibilities with respect to inputs being empty, and do not care 
about matching between the inputs.

But that is redundant information. I was actually confused by that part of 
the table for a long time, because it was not clear that it followed a 
couple of simple rules (which I give above the table), and weren't 
actually chosen on a case-by-case basis.

The implementation I did is actually much easier to verify, because it 
doesn't go into each case for the index requirements, but checks the 
actual rules: the index must match either the head or (if there is one) 
the merge result, and the index must not be dirty if there is a "no merge" 
result. Therefore, you can't lose any work in the index (either you didn't 
have any, or you did the same thing), and you can't lose any work in the 
working tree (either you didn't have any, or we're not going to use the 
working tree).

Last time we discussed it ("Multi-ancestor read-tree notes"), you said:

  I like the second sentence in three-way merge description.  That
  is a very easy-to-understand description of what the index
  requirements are.

"If the index exists, it is an error for it not to match either the
 head or (if the merge is trivial) the result."

"A result of "no merge" is an error if the index is not empty and not
 up-to-date."

So the index is permitted to not exist (you missed this case), but if it 
exists, it must match HEAD (or, well, HEAD, which is the result). The 
index need not be up-to-date (since the result is not "no merge"), so the 
working tree doesn't matter.

Certainly, your complaints about the table should be addressed first. I 
think I'd addressed all your complaints from last time, but at that point, 
we got sidetracked into a discussion of the details of case #16.
