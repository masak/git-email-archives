Dear diary, on Fri, Nov 11, 2005 at 04:18:31AM CET, I got a letter
where Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org> said that...

I plan to change the fast-forward condition in Cogito from

	is_ancestor(current, new_head)

to

	current == old_head || is_ancestor(current, new_head)

which should enable you to do this - just rebase, and it will Just Work
for those cg-update'ing from you; the only problem si that cg-fetch +
cg-merge will NOT work, but I have no simple workaround for that.

I already proposed this several times and it was always passed in
silence, so I assume there are no problems with this approach.
