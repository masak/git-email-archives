I don't agree.

Sure, B _may_ be the right answer for a particular merge strategt, but 
there's no way of knowing. Maybe all the big changes came in through F, 
and H is the merge that sorted that out, and E actually ends up being the 
better base.

So I think from a correctness standpoint, the only thing that matters is 
"git-merge-base --all", and anything that doesn't know to return both E 
and B looks potentially buggy.

> Actually git-merge-base without --all only mentions E.

Well, we should really consider anything that doesn't take them all into 
account to be a bug waiting to happen (or rather, a merge waiting for a 
disaster), but E is the right one, since it's the more recent one).

Now, this case obviously depends on history being almost maximally insane 
(ie pretty much _all_ the dates are wrong). So in practice we probably 
don't care.

So maybe "git-show-branch --merge-base" ends up acceptable as a faster way 
to do the quick "let's see if we can find _some_ merge-base to do the 
in-index merge with", but personally I'd much rather always do a 
"git-merge-base --all", and only do the fast index merge if we only have 
one potential parent.

That way there would never any question about what the "quick merge" does.
