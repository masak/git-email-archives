Yes. The change to a tree (which is equalent to 2 trees - new old and
the new one; or for merges multiple old ones and the new one) does not
depend on any history. Unfortunately, we have no separate object to
specify the "the change to a tree". We include this information into
the commit object, and thus, bind it to the history.

This could be changed in git, i.e. put the tree relationship into a
separate object; even comments could be split up in change related and
history related. The question is: is this useful, is there any
important usage scenario that rectifies such a change?
I do not really think so.

No, the resulting tree is an independent object, it is the tree ;-)
Do not confuse this with the commit pointing to the tree.

I agree that tags for tree objects are useful, but what is the problem?
You can do this already.

But tags for commit objects are equally useful, especially signed ones:
they include a fixed history which can not be changed. Eg. they include
all the people which attributed code to the project, and this is important
for license questions. This is the reason that "grafting" should stay
a local workaround.

That the concrete tag "linux-2.6.11" points to a commit, and not to the
tree object, probably was done on purpose; i.e. the creator of the tag
wanted to include the history. If not, he could have made the tag for the
tree object directly.

Hmm.. If you only have tree changes, there is no history. The history
specifies an order of the changes. The changes themselve do not include
any such order.

It would be better to not talk about "commits" for tree changes (perhaps
with comments about the change). As said above, tree change objects
could be introduced. The question is why?

No problem: You still have the chain of commits, and one commit points
to the parent commit(s) and the corresponding new introduced tree change
objects.

There is nothing lost. If you regard the comments entered at "git commit"
time as purely change related, this comments can be put together with the
tree change object. So if you "apply a graft to a tree", (signed) tags for tree
changes would include the comment, and stay valid after "regrafting".
But why would anyone want to sign a change?

What is the difficult problem here?
