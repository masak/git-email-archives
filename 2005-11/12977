Er... why are these flags zero-based?

git-ls-files -s displays them as "1", "2" and "3".  All the docs talk
about "stage1", "stage2" and "stage3".

Change the nomenclature if you want, but this mixed messages business is
kind of weird...

(Heartened by the response to my previous question of "why do you do
this thing that makes no sense to me", I'm going to be bold and not ask
why this is a good idea.)
