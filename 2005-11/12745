Dear diary, on Fri, Nov 25, 2005 at 11:11:22PM CET, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> said that...

Note that Cogito is now (v0.15.1 or later) supposed to handle merges on
top of trees with local changes fine - it will either error out, or in
case the merge is done on unrelated files it will temporarily ignore
your local changes and cg-commit won't mix them up (even if you do some
conflict fixups).
