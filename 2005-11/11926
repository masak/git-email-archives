Wow.  How is the acceptance by wine community?  Favorable, I
hope.

It would be nice before 1.0 happens to have a list of publicly
visible projects and people who use git as part of the workflow;
the degree would vary per project, from using it as the primary
repository (the kernel, I guess) to merely accessible with git.

git-cvsexportcommit?  I haven't had a chance to use it myself,
although I have to interoperate with CVS in some projects.
Martin, do you want to do a plug (or brag) here?

> I find git-rebase to be particularly useful.

It is handy, especially for simple things like rebasing topic
branches, when the things are of managable size without using
quilt or StGIT.  Do you manage binary files?

Yes, I saw that value there.  Maybe adding hooks to format-patch
so that it can do form-letter-ish things you had to add there
without patching might help?  I dunno.
