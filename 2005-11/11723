Dear diary, on Sun, Nov 13, 2005 at 03:34:02AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...

I think we need either the balanced packing or this.

Sort the objects topologically, then get everything from the old heads
on. Obviously, this will not work so well when we get multiple heads in
single pack, but either don't do that (would it be actually so bad if we
would create one pack per head?), or:

  (i) objects are topologically sorted
  (ii) objects introduced by a commit/tree are right after the commit or
       tree in the pack file
  (iii) index file contains parents list for each commit

This way, you can possibly run through the gaps, or if the gap is big
enough, restart the request. You still will miss objects introduced by
commits in different branches, but in case of trees you can slurp the
trees at once again, and pick the individual objects otherwise; while
doing this second pass, you can apply the gaps strategy again.
