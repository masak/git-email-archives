I went with this implementation because when I tried to break it up I 
had to add the chdir() and putenv() calls in the three callers. No 
programs in the git-suite tries to resolve the canonical path of a repo 
without subsequently entering it and using it.

Perhaps it should be enter_repo() or some such? Optionally with 
is_git_repo() as a separate function?
