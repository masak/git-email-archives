It uses whatever the /bin/mail program on your system uses. This is 
usually done by spooling the mail for delivery by the local MTA which 
doesn't have to listen to any ports anywhere (mutt and friends work the 
same way).

Having an MTA installed is a requirement of the LSB. The /bin/mail 
program requires that it's running, which the sendmail binary doesn't. 
The sendmail binary is always shipped along with an MTA though, so to 
get around having one at all one would have to re-implement the SMTP 
protocol (which Mail::Sendmail does, but without authentication). I can 
do that in C if you like. That way you can have support for SMTP over 
SSL with all sorts of funny authentication mechanisms.

The good thing about using the local MTA is that you get that for free 
with very thoroughly tested code and you only have to set it up once 
rather than passing all the auth stuff repeatedly on the command-line 
each time you want to submit a patch.
