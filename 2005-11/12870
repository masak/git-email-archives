Dear diary, on Mon, Nov 28, 2005 at 02:52:08AM CET, I got a letter

Yes, but precisely what I want to do is to avoid (most of) the "added
value" of the remotes concept, if you will. Also, it really is a
different namespace than branches (while branches share the same
namespace with heads); I can try to make the namespaces match, but when
they suddenly won't, you are in big mess.

As I said, I don't care much if this moves to the git configuration
file, but please don't merge it with the remotes.
