The main reason I don't like indentation is that it tends to have strange 
rules for "tab". Some people (incorrectly, of course) think that tabs are 
not at fixed 8-byte things, so deciding the indentation of a tab often 
ends up either disallowing tabs altogether (bad) or having other strange 
rules (disallowing spaces).

So I'm not religiously opposed to it, but I find it to be less than 
optimal.

I'd rather have just _pure_ braces, but while that is natural to 
programmers, it's not very natural to most users, I think.
