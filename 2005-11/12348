I think this was resolved some weeks ago. Perhaps you could try the 
latest cogito from git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/cogito.git ?

There aren't that many. This particular one was a typo, iirc.

As for rsync; From the output you posted above, you were setting up both 
the repositories on your local machine. Using rsync for those cases 
would be pretty stupid.

On a side-note, could you please turn off your spamvertising auto-reply? 
It sends me some info about your perl-expertise and contact-numbers 
every now and then. It's getting a bit annoying.
