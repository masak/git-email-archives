Caching itself is relatively easy (just implement an equivalent
of tee inside pack-objects ourselves).  More problematic is
pruning.  We could do it from cron based on atime _if_ the
filesystem is not mounted noatime but without arranging a
reasonably way for automated pruning this would become a disk
hog and extra maintenance burden, which is why I did not
implement the dynamic caching part in the initial round.

Since git-daemon would be the primary user of pack-cache/, this
implies a repository writable by git-daemon user on public
machine (not master), which is an extra thing to note.
