Dear diary, on Sun, Nov 06, 2005 at 09:15:38PM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

You are also going to break the porcelains (w/o manual user
intervention), so I'm not happy about it but if you are doing it, do it
now, please. :-)

BTW, can I easily get the patch from the 'git' tool, so that I can
extend $PATH appropriately during Cogito initialization?
