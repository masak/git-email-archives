Dear diary, on Sat, Nov 12, 2005 at 08:40:11PM CET, I got a letter

(BTW, it's obviously not much slower than HTTP - I wrote that after the
first git run, but I screwed up myself at that one.)

Well, at the time of fetching, master.kernel.org with git+ssh had load
about ~3.5 and some wild gzip was eating most of the CPU there. So if
the git protocol still manages to be TEN times slower while rsync goes
full speed from that machine, I would say that this means the git server
requires way too much CPU.
