I think it 'stg resolved' should be fixed as well (in case there are
unmerged entries for other reasons). My initial idea was to make
gitmergeonefile not to leave any unmerged entries in the index. As you
could see, there are cases where it failed.

I can see the following scenarios for a file:

1. deleted in the base and modified by the patch. It should leave the
file in the tree together with file.older. Another option would be to
remove the file and leave both file.older and file.remote in the tree
(here .remote means the version in the patch) but I would prefer the
first one.

2. changed in the base but deleted by the patch. It should remove the
file from the tree but leave file.older and file.local. The other
option is to leave the file in the tree but, as above, I prefer the
first one.

Maybe StGIT should try to track the renaming as well but I haven't
played with this feature in GIT at all.
