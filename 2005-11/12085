yes that was a bad example, actually I've tried several protocol
including git protocol.

hmm, don't think "linux mips" repository is rooted like yours. It
seems that it has been imported from mips cvs repository which
contains linux-mips history since 1995.

well I've already tried that but have renounced after waiting more
than 4 hours ! I don't know if the server was under heavy load or if
git protocol needs a lots of resources but it seems useless to setup a
git dameon on it...

Sorry, I forget to tell that I have already tried what you suggested
at first (except that I did not do a 'git repack -a -d') but it didn't
work out (and that the reason why I tried the "kill father object"
thing). Since I forgot the repack thing, I retried again, and it did
last more than 4 hours to cpmplete all git commands. After that I run
gitk --all to check that all old branch's objects have been removed
but I can see all of them.

I plan to take look at git code to understand how object removal is
done, but until this do you have any ideas why this fails ?

Thanks
