Certainly, I'm not sure what conditions make sense for using packs
though.

When pushing changes to the server, there's an advantage to using loose
objects in that there is no way to resume a failed transfer.  So if the
network barfs 99% of the way through, you'll be much less annoyed if
you need to retransmit the one object rather than a whole pack.

The same problem exists if you decide to pack loose objects on the
server since the pack would have to be generated locally and then sent
to the server.  At least in this case, other remote clients would still
be able to fetch loose objects while packs were in transit.

Which files are those?  I've been working on a way to update info/refs
and eventually objects/info/packs.
