Not so great.  Why is it so much more difficult to have one more level
of nesting?  It's annoying, but it's a lot less annoying than having 19
separate threads that are all, in fact, related to each other.

Perhaps adding a 'sleep 1' would help?  (The delay may be unacceptable
to some people, though.)
