That was not what was unpleasant.  What was unpleasant was those
"unmerged" messages were buried under heap of normal diffs,
showing the successfully merged entries as the result of merge.

I am inclined to munge your patch to do this:

 * Change -0/-1/-2 to -1/-2/-3 to be consistent with stage
   numbers, for technically minded.

 * Give --base, --ours, and --theirs as synonyms for -1/-2/-3,
   for end users.

 * Change it not to pick other unmerged stage (I sent a separate
   message about this already).

 * Change the diff_unmerged_stage default to 0.  While you are
   inspecting a conflicted merge, you need to give --ours (or
   -2) explicitly.  Alternatively we could first check if the
   whole index is unmerged and make it default to 2 without
   flags, but that would mean inspecting 19K entries first
   before starting the main loop for the kernel for normal case.
   With hot cache it is fine, so I'll try it first.

   This "with unmerged defaults to 2 otherwise defaults to 0"
   behaviour needs to be made overridable with an option, say -0
   (or --merged, but that is overkill); otherwise you cannot get
   diffs for merged paths until the index file is unmerged.

 * When diff_unmerged_stage is zero, keep the current behaviour.
   Show diff for only specified stage when diff_unmerged_stage
   is not zero.
