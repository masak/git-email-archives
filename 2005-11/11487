Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 10, 2005 at 06:44:43PM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...

It was the Large Angry SCM. I share your concern.

I like Daniel's route as well, for the separate command. But it would be
nice to also have a way to tell git-fsck-cache to save the lost+found
refs as it goes, much like the filesystem fsck. So if it reports some
unreachable refs, you will not need to tell it to do the same job
_another_ time to find out the refs and pass them to gitk. Then again,
if we do this, the utility of a separate command will be questionable.
