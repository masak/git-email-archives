I see you are resending the previous round after splitting, but
could you be a bit more careful about the commit log?  One liner
title that is self-sufficient (as opposed to just the initial
part of one sentence, cut off at whereever your editor happened
to decide to fold line), which goes to Subject:, and the body of
the message as a separate paragraph.

Especially something like this (5/7) does not make much sense:

    From: Yaacov Akiba Slama <ya@slamail.org>
    Subject: [PATCH 5/7] When copying files and/or directories from several branches in one single
    Date: Wed, 02 Nov 2005 23:51:57 +0200

    revision, all these branches are used as parents of the commit.
