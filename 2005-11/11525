I think this is wrong.

Why would anybody want to fetch the current upstream HEAD at cg-pull
time? If you do this, and you have no control on the upstream
repository, "origin" will jump randomly around after cg-pull, depending
on the current HEAD of the origin repository.

Besides, this is a incompatible change in cg-pull behavior: I am sure that
a lot of people did a cg-clone in the past without any specific remote branch,
and expect that cg-pull will update their origin to the remote "master".
Now, if they update to a new Cogito with this patch, the next cg-pull
sometimes will rebase their origin to another random branch, depending
on remote HEAD ?!

Or am I missing something here?
