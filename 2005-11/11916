Dear diary, on Tue, Nov 15, 2005 at 06:33:44PM CET, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> said that...

If you show me a way how to do git-symbolic-ref over HTTP, I will be
most grateful. :-)

Seriously though, if people have huge problem with having symbolic refs
by default, that's unfortunate since we have two possibilities which are
not equally tested, but I can live with it - just give me a way to
configure that behaviour per-repository, so that I can make GIT use
symbolic refs in public repositories (or I can whip up a patch myself at
the evening, after all...).
