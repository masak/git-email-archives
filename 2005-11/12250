I did the above patch on top of "pu", which contained the patch
from Pavel Roskin and sent it out.  Later I saved the message
from my mbox, went back to the "master" branch, whose Makefile
had the releveant part like this:

        ifeq ($(uname_O),Cygwin)
                NO_STRCASESTR = YesPlease
                NEEDS_LIBICONV = YesPlease
                NO_IPV6 = YesPlease
                X = .exe
                ALL_CFLAGS += -DUSE_SYMLINK_HEAD=0
        endif

Notice ALL_CFLAGS line?  The patch does not apply cleanly and
usual e-mail patch application tool would have barfed; git-apply
would not allow any fuzz, and patch would have dropped a .rej
file.

However, I usually run "git-am" with --3way option enabled when
applying the e-mailed patches.  After git-apply failed, it
noticed I am applying on top of a different blob, namely, the
Makefile from somewhere else (it reads the "index 7ce62e8"),
then fell back on 3-way merge and made a clean commit.  Happy.

Back to day-job.
