StGIT first tries a "git-diff-tree | git-apply" since it is faster but
when this fails it falls back to a three-way merge. A 'stg status'
command would show the conflicted files and they should be marked as
resolved before refreshing the patch.

One of the good parts of the three-way merge is that it detects when a
patch you sent was fully merged upstream, the local patch becoming
empty after the merge. If not, you either get a conflict or the merge
leaves the patch with only the unmerged parts.
