It is not really fitting for all purposes (eg. syntax restrictions).

In fact, it would be nice to have different "config levels" supported
by git. I can imagine:
(1) user config (typically in $HOME/.gitrc)
(2) project config (in .git/project.conf)
(3) repository config; i.e. separate for every clone
    (in .git/repo.conf instead of .git/config as of now?)
Even for one such level, it would be nice to be able to seperate the
config into multiple files; ie. remote config in a .git/remote.conf,
and a porcelain should be able to have its own config files, but still
using git's config parser.

To allow for this, git_config() should not be hardcoded to only
read .git/config, but perhaps a list of files in environment variable
GIT_CONFIG_FILES.

For (2), git-clone should copy some files, e.g. the .git/project.conf
or .git/info/exclude. But project config probably should be kept
up to date among all repositories for a project, i.e. it should be
version controlled itself, but independent from the project.
We could use a project config head .git/refs/projectconfig for this;
of course post-1.0 material.
