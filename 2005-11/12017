Dear diary, on Wed, Nov 16, 2005 at 03:38:42PM CET, I got a letter
where Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@pobox.com> said that...

What kind of people have no hosting whatsoever? There is plenty of free
web hosting sites, and that should be enough...?

> - is this all pointless, since the submittor could just email patches? 
> [IMO no, git trees are better merges than emailed patches]

Couldn't you just look at the applies-to string of the first patch in
the series, branch up from that commit, and at the end of the series do
the merge?

No special tool required, just a bit smarter applier.
