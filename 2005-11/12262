Well the reality tells that everything that is successful does not give
too many options that harm adoption. For me it's a very simple and "real"
rule.

It's all about a sane default, which git obviously doesn't have. You
guys may look at it from the very low level, but that isn't what I call
"reality".

Actually, the real bug is not to try to prevent binary nonsense in textual
commit logs, which are distibuted. Remember, that you provide a SCM not a
filesystem.

Well, I don't see real arguments against sane a default.
