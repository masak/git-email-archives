The first sign-off really isn't necessarily the author.

It might be a company sign-off (many companies don't want any random 
engineer to send out patches), but much more commonly it's a trivial patch 
that somebody else signs off on, even if the original patcher didn't (see 
case (b) in the sign-off-rules: you can sign of on somebody elses work if 
you know it's under the GPL).

So the fact that there was a sign-off procedure doesn't automatically mean 
that the author will be the first sign-off person, although in _practice_ 
that obviously would likely always be the most common case by far.

(Another reason is that some people actually add the sign-offs above 
previous ones. It happens, although if I notice, I try to point it out).

So authorship really is totally separate from sign-off, and all _my_ tools 
take the authorship from the first "From:" line at the top of the message 
body or from the email itself.
