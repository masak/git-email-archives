Is it possible that the UTF-8 check in gitweb running on
kernel.org machine is somehow too strict?

The following two commits in git.git repository are not showing
properly.

I have a track record of getting peoples' names wrong, so I
double checked my commit objects, and as far as I can tell, all
of them are encoded in UTF-8 properly (or at least I can view
what I expect if I throw raw bytes from the commit objects at my
Firefox):

        c3df8568424684bbcc7df7722eb3ec34bdae8b2d

        This is from Yoshifuji-san; the third character in
        author name field is mangled.

	bb931cf9d73d94d9940b6d0ee56b6c13ad42f1a0

	This is from Lukas Sandstr*m; o with Umlaut on top is
	showing a ?.  Incidentally, the blob that records recent
	version of Documentation/git-pack-redundant.txt has his
	name in it, which has the same ? problem, but "plain"
	option shows his name correctly in UTF-8.

Interestingly enough, my name spelled in Japanese
(Documentatino/git-lost-found.txt) is intact.  Am I getting a
VIP treatment somehow?
