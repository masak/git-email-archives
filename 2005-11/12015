Yep, I was thinking that too but was too lazy to implement.

Actually, with .git/commits we are reimplementing handling of "unmerged" 
entries... it could be better to use the "unmerged entry" stgit idea. So "stg 
resolved" should modify the entries by itself.

Yep... it seems you took examples from git-merge-one-file, but that's lacking 
(but it's low-level so it's appropriate for it - it must leave unmerged 
entries when there are conflicts).

Why not leaving file.remote? We already do that in general, so we have a 
duplicate, but it's easier to understand.

I remember that at times, but .remote is very confusing... I see that's the 
mishandling is induced by various sources, maybe including "merge" itself, 
but that program (and possibly others) supports changing the labels, and this 
should probably be done (using "original", "patched" and "upstream" 
probably).

The policy about when to remove the file and when to leave it is very 
personal... the user must anyway solve the conflict in some smart way... 
about the defaults, anything would do, but if we really care we could leave 
the user the choice.

For the Linux kernel, my experience is that when a file is removed it's either 
because it's renamed, it's refactored, or it's removed. In all these cases, 
there's often little interest in reviving it in the patch... However it's 
just a slight preference.
