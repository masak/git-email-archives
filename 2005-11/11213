Thanks Junio,

   as you said, the speed is almost the same but your way is clearly better.

I have pushed the change.

P.S.: Could be interesting something like?:
     
          git-diff-tree -r --name-status --diff-filter=^M sha1 sha2

I have impemented a tree viewer inside qgit. Tree view is updated when user browses through
revisions.

Loading the file names of a given tree, altough only for the open directories, is an expensive
operation. So I added a little "same files" test to skip tree reloading.

With "same files" I mean that the file list is the same bewteen tree1 and tree1, _not_ that the
files content are the same. As example, if tree1 is parent of tree2 (and tree2 is not a merge) and
the revision between the two only modified files (git-diff-tree status is M), in my test tree1 and
tree2 have the same files, also if sha's are, of course, different.

Put in other way, two trees have the "same files" if I don't have to repaint the tree view window.
