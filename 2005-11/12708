Fair enough.  Is "git-push ssh://these.machines/" (or from
these.machines "git-fetch ssh://mother.ship/") more trouble than
having HTTP server on your mother ship machine?

Hmph.  I had an impression that the obscure URL scheme like in
my example http://members.cox.net/junkio/r0ZIEF/5S54m/ is as
robot safe as auth embedding URL.  That is, if somebody feeds
auth-embedding URL to robots I suspect they can follow it just
fine.  Of course obscure URL needs to be protected by forbidding
dirindex at higher level directories and not posting it to
public forum [*1*], for the same reason you have to keep the
auth embedding URL from public.

[Footnote]

*1* I suspect some robots have already tried to harvest what is
found at that URL since I posted the message to the list.
