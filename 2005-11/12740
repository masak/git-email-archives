The moral of the story is not to push into the checked-out
branch of a non-naked repository, or you need to do what you are
doing if you choose to do so.  It might have made sense if index
file recorded which tree object its contents came from, but I am
not sure what tools is responsible for recording that if we
choose to extend index file to store that information.  Probably
read-tree is, but it should not do that unconditionally.

In any case, the workflow presented by Nick is that individual
developers use cg-* commands in CVS like workflow where the only
place you push into is the central repository and everybody
pulls from there, so I do not think the above example applies.
