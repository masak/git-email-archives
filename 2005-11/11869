If I am not mistaken, I thought the last thread on the list
showed general consensus that symlinks were preferred when
available.  So applying this patch anytime would be
controversial...

Which is...?  I do not think this paragraph justifies it:

The one format is that .git/HEAD can either be a symlink or
regular file text symref; both variants are tested -- wouldn't
that be good enough?

The only thing I can think of that might be inconvenient is if
you try doing "cp -a" off of a filesystem that supports symlinks
to another filesystem that does not -- probably that would fail
copying the symlinked .git/HEAD.  But if that is the problem,
you could always git-clone, which should do the right thing, I
think.
