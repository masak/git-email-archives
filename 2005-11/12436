Hello,

Can ypu please explain how to use cvsimport with cvsexportcommit scripts ? 

I have tried these steps:
1. Make git repo from cvs repo using cvsimport command - everything works 
great.
2. Start traking cvs changes by incremental running cvsimport - It works.
3. Change files in git repo (master branch) - works :-)
4. Export git commits to cvs: 
      first question: What should be exported and in what order ? Lets skip 
this part - it is the smallest problem.
      Two test commits were exported to cvs without any problmes.
5. Importing cvs again - I have found my exported commits became separate 
commits in git repo in origin branch (solved by git-pull . origin). But thay 
were merged idealy.
6. Changing files again in git.
7. Export git commits to cvs: What should be exported question become harder 
and harder. Possible I should use some tag and run:
git-rev-list MY-TAG..master | xargs -n 1 git-cvsexportcommit -vX -cX (by the 
way, why just -v -c does not work ? I must add something to make options 
work)

This cycle is a bit of mess. I can write some scripts but I have no idea how 
this is supposed to work !

The biggest problem - conflict. I should resove them twice, during merging 
origin branch to master and when exporting these changes to cvs. By the way, 
I still can't export merge commit :-)

Thanks for help.
Alexander Litvinov.
