All right, I've asked about this functionality in the other thread, and
something like this seems to cut it (although I would just /\([^.=]*\)/
instead of restricting the remote name).

However, it's a nice example of horrible interface. And confusing one
at it, too.

Why git-var -l?! That makes no sense to me. git-var's function is to
"print the git users identity" (no matter that it is grammatically
wrong, that's what the synopsis says). This is something totally else,
and I can't see what bussiness does this have in the git-var command.
This should belong into git-repo-config, which manages the rest of the
config-related stuff.

C'mon people, git's interface is inconsistent enough as it is now,
no need to make it even worse. ;-)
