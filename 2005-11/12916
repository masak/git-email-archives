That's what I'm doing currently, actually (with work pushing to 
"production", but server having checked out "deploy"), and I find it 
annoying to have to do the pull each time and have a separate head. It 
also means that, if the stuff on the server is set up as a hook, it'll 
have to do the locking against concurrent changes to the working tree in 
pull, which is much more complicated than checkout.

It's also somewhat non-intuitive, and leaves a surprising way for the user 
to confuse the system in a way that it can't detect.
