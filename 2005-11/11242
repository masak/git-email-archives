I suspect /(\S.*)$/ would do the same thing, but in any case
I do not think it is the right fix.

I think the problem is deeper than that.  Shortlog summarizes to
only one line per commit, so I suspect what you would be feeding
it would say something like this for the above example:

        commit f1b2646c7f2713c3ea4bce120e1d0d8091808be4
        Author: Adrian Bunk <bunk@r063144.stusta.swh.mhn.de>

            From: Michal Wronski <wrona@mat.uni.torun.pl>

That is, the commit you quoted is done by 'git log --pretty',
but a typical shortlog invocation would be:

	git log --pretty=short rev1..rev2 | git shortlog

With or without your fix, the command barfs.

Of course, that "From: " line should have been used as the
commit author by the tool that created the commit out of e-mail
Adrian received, but that is a separate issue.
