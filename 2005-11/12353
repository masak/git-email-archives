Well, I got what I wanted... someone pointing me to a simple explanation.
However, I'm still lost.  When would I do this, and what will the
effect be?

Is this what I would use if I want to discard history except for
major milestones?  Like if I had:

        A - edit - edit - edit - B - edit - edit - edit - C

and I wanted to really just retain:

        A - B - C

Or is this just to make it look like:

        C

Still not sure what "cherry-pick" is either. And that's *not*
in the glossary. :)

I'm just worried about my archive getting bigger and bigger and
having lots of junk in it that I can't get rid of.
