OK,

To follow-up on this.  Here is a final version of this script that was
started by Junio.  I polished it and made it work the way I want it.
Hopefully, someone on the list will find it useful.

Here is a basic description.  There are two files:
.git/info/allowed-users
.git/info/allowed-groups

The users file is checked, line by line, followed by the groups file.
The first line matching the ref to be updated is used.  Each line has
one regular expression to match the ref followed by one or more regular
expressions to match user (or group).  Space is the delimeter so the RE
cannot contain a space.

If no line matches the ref then access is denied.  For this reason I
tend to include the following line as the last line of allowed-groups as
the default since it will match any ref and any group.

.* .*

Here is the hook script...  Thanks to Junio for getting me started.  I
rewrote the whole thing using my own style but much of the code is based
on his.
