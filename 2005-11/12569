I have done some tests, and unfortunatley I saw approx. zero
improvement with Alex's patch. (less than 10ms difference when
total runtime is 1.850s, tested on http://home.arcor.de/fork0/download/idx.tar.gz)

Did someone else notice an improvement?

It's a nice idea though. I'll look into doing slab-allocation
for the fun of it, but I'm not really sure that malloc is the
bottleneck.
