Related to this, I've been wondering whether it'd be possible to teach
git to rebase local patches, even if that means rewriting local
history. When you are dealing with team shared repo, the sequences of
pull/push end up being quite messy, full of little meaningless merges.
Similarly, when dealing with an upstream, my tree gets slowly out of
sync and slightly messy. Eventually I get a new checkout, and rebase
any pending patches with git-format-patch and git-am.

The same process would be much easier if I could just cg-update from
the repo and get it to try and actually rebase my local commits --
rewriting history as if I had committed them after the update. Of
course, it'd be cheating... but we cheat all the time anyway, we only
sweat harder at it ;-)

cheers,


martin
