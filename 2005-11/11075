Wonderful.

Maybe I just failed to notice this too, but I do not think so.

My preference is put something in .git/config to describe which
proxy command (maybe the same one with different argument) to
use depending on where you are going.  When you have internal
hosts and external hosts you would want this to apply only to
external hosts.  Maybe you have two or more gateways and
depending on which external host you are going you may want to
use different proxied connection.  On top of the config file,
making it overridable from an environment variable would be
sensible.
