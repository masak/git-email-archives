Here is an unsolicited advice ("tip of the day").

I was on a branch which had some local "throwaway" changes, and
I wanted to switch back to the master branch.  To be honest, I
even forgot I had local changes there.  So I ran "git checkout",
and here is what happened.

        junio@siamese:~/git$ git checkout master
        fatal: Entry 'Documentat...' not uptodate. Cannot merge.

The easiest is "git checkout -f master" at this point, but I
usually do not do that.  If that entry "git checkout" complains
about is something that is not in the master branch and I have
throwaway changes, "git checkout -f master" would leave that
file with throwaway changes behind.  So I did this first:

        junio@siamese:~/git$ git reset --hard

This would sync my working tree to the current branch.  Then

        junio@siamese:~/git$ git checkout master

would switch branches properly, removing that new file that
should not exist in the working tree.
