Funny that I asked exactly the same question when it was done
first:

	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=git&m=111804744926989

It was a question about then-current code, so other cases might
have been changed/corrected/enhanced since then, but I believe
the behaviour for the case in question here stays the same til
this day, and the response from Linus to that article still
applies.


	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=git&m=111807024201485

I'll quote only the punch line here, but the whole thing is
worth a read if you want to understand how this evolved and
what the design choices and decisions were:

  Right. We didn't lose anything hugely important. 

  In theory this could be a delete that we've missed, and we could add a 
  flag to actually reject this case. However, it's always easy to "recover" 
  deletes (just delete it again ;), so the loss of information is absolutely 
  minimal, and it allows starting from an empty index file.
