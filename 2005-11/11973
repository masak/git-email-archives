Funny.  These two are what I meant by "make the template
instantiation first thing".  So instead of the hardcoded
only_symbolic_ref assignment and filemode check code, can't we
do something like this?

 - copy the template; if the commandline specifies where the
   templates are, take them from there otherwise use the
   built-in location.

 - read from config; note if you actually read any (may not have
   config in your template suite, or you might not have
   templates at all).

 - do filemode check, and maybe git_config_set() there and write
   the result back as the new config for that repository.

 - create the rest, including the HEAD ref.

The user could even have more than one template set (one for
VFAT and another for non VFAT).  Once we go that route, we may
not even need the special filemode check code in init-db.  No?
