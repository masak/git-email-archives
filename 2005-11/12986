Correction.  The above is a faulty memory, and does not happen,
with or without your "stage0 or stage2" patch.  Cleanly merged
paths are written out to working tree and collapsed to stage0 in
the index, so diff-files wouldn't have shown them at all.  

Sorry about the confused statement.  What I saw was my local
modifications on the paths unrelated to the merge.
