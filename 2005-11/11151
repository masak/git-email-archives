Yes, the unpleasantness of CVS.

However, I was unable to do a proper git-cvsimport of the SourceForge 'vim'
archive, with '-k'.  By not giving it '-k' and using cvs admin '-ko' on the
appropriate files, I was able to get the correct results.

May be the interpretation of the option depends on the particular server
being used?

I can investigate later which particular file is causing the problem.
