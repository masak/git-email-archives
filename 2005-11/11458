Maybe reliable and consistent but I think that info would need a bit  
of augmentation to use for specifying autocompletion - for example,  
in the case of:

 > Usage: cg-branch-add BRANCH_NAME LOCATION

BRANCH_NAME should *not* exist so it doesn't make sense to  
autocomplete from the branch list, but in the case of:

 > Usage: cg-fetch [-f] [-v] [BRANCH_NAME]

BRANCH_NAME *must* exist so it makes sense to autocomplete from the  
branch list.

The amount of augmentation is probably not too much -  probably  
sufficient  to specify for each parameter a completion-source(s)  
(heads, branches, filenames, blah) that doesn't get displayed in -- 
help. But this is more information to maintain and get out of date...

I wonder if Nikolai has had thoughts about that for zsh completion?
Hopefully if anything gets added, it would be useful for both zsh and  
bash

(I confess to having pretty much no idea how zsh completion works...)
