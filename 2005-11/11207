Yes. I wish there was some way around that.

Right now, for a 1.0 release, I suspect that the "put the git binaries 
somewhere else" just isn't worth it. It will break existing scripts that 
use the binaries directly (we've already broken the kernel.org snapshot 
scripts about a million times with just _renaming_ the binaries ;)

It would still be nice to not screw up peoples /usr/bin too badly. At 
least we have the nice property that our git programs sort together and 
can pretty much be wild-carded (not everybody uses package installers, and 
on one machine I had just done "make prefix=/usr install" and was happy to 
be able to basically remove it with "rm /usr/bin/git-*")
