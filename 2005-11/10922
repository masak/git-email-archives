Dear diary, on Tue, Nov 01, 2005 at 10:23:55AM CET, I got a letter

Perhaps you could emulate the topical branches - one patch == one head.
E.g. for patch foo-bar on branch 'master', you would create head
master/foo-bar, etc.

I'd prefer the snapshotting being done in refresh anyway. Perhaps you
would be asked for log message when you refresh by default, but when you
refresh -n or something, only a temporary commit would be created and
next refresh would mutate it instead of creating another commit.

Anyway, "freeze" is confusing. Perhaps "snapshot" if anything...
