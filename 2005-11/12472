This is problematic, because it means something that isn't in GIT_DIR 
affects its interpretation.  I would say that that is a showstopper.

One could even argue that it's incorrect, since it would mean different 
points on the history have different grafts.

Now, CVS has a reserved namespace (CVSROOT/) for things under version 
control which are still significant to CVS.  The logical equivalent to 
git would be to have .git/ be such a namespace, if it makes sense.
