There is a misunderstanding here. We don't pass '-kk' to the cvs
utility -- we pass it at the protocol level. Strangely enough, when
passing ko we were getting broken files, and when passing kk we got
all the files correctly. I explored and tested this quite a bit when I
added the flag, and explicitly tested it with files that _would_ get
broken with cvs update -kk.

To recap: my main test repository has a lot of binary files, files
that do get broken if I do a cvs checkout with -kk. git-cvsimport gets
them right with its -k parameter. Don't ask me why, though: the cvs
protocol is really messy, and I suspect that part of the -kk option is
being 'implemented' on the client side.

(That being said, if you have a case where git-cvsimport is doing the
wrong thing, let me know!)

Yes, but a repo you don't control, where people are using keywords,
means thatyou need to do -kk to kill the keywords or your imported
files are going to have a horrid amount of noise in them.
