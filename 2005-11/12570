It definitely does, though nor very much. I have no real numbers at
hand (being home now), but I remember it was 1 min with against 3 min
without the patch on cygwin+fat32, which is already bad enough all by
itself. Very big repository with no redundant packs in it.

Like this?

    if ( free_nodes ) { ... }
    else {
	struct llist_node *slab = malloc(sizeof(*slab) * BLKCNT);
	for ( i =0; i < BLKCNT; ++i ) {
	    slab->next = free_nodes;
	    free_nodes = slab++;
	}
    }
