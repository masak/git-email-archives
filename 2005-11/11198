Well, there's no standard libexpat for OSX, so if you install it
after-market, it can end up in various directories.

For example, on my machine, I've installed it with fink, so I need
"-I/sw/include -L/sw/lib" added to CFLAGS.

If you install it with darwinports, it will end up under
"/opt/local/{lib,include}" instead.

I suppose you could add those four things to CFLAGS for OSX and it
won't mess too many things up, but you'll also need to add a note that
says "git requires expat, which can be obtained through fink or
darwinports.  If you install expat manually, you may have to adjust
CFLAGS in the Makefile".

As a separate problem, why make git depend on expat if the only part
of this is for DAV pushing?  Can http-push simply refuse DAV URLs if
built without expat?
