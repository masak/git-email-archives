Guys,

  I just hit my first real rename conflict, and very timidly tried the 
"recursive" strategy in the hopes that I wouldn't need to do things by 
hand.

It resolved things beautifully. Good job. 

My only worry is that I don't read python, so I don't really know how it 
does what it does, which makes me nervous. Can somebody (Fredrik?) add 
some documentation about the merge strategy and how it works.

Considering that the stupid resolve strategy really requires you to know 
how git works when rename conflicts happen (things left in unmerged state 
are really quite hard to handle by hand unless you know exactly what 
you're doing), I'd almost suggest making "recursive" the default. I'm a 
bit nervous about it, but knowing how it works would probably put most of 
that to rest.
