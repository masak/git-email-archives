Dear diary, on Mon, Nov 07, 2005 at 01:11:33AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Ok, I'm not a die-hard proponent of this change (the genesis is that it
comes from the ages before .mailmap was supported and was originally
coupled with -n which disabled the internal mappings - but then .mailmap
got supported, I deemed -n useless but this still seemed worth something
so I passed it along), but I think it can be useful - either when you
want to work on readonly tree, or when you want to support custom
mailmap in addition to the default project's one without interference...
*shrug*
