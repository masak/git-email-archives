OK, will do.

yeah, I was thinking about that this morning -- maybe I'll be in the  
mood to implement...

There are a few small common functions that are used by all the git  
completions, though. I suppose for going into cogito's contrib/ I  
should include them directly in cogito completion code, but that  
seems a little messy, as it would be nice to keep them in-sync with  
what is used in the other completion files. hmm.
