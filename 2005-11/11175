Just for fun, I did "git-<tab><tab>" a moment ago, and it asked me

	Display all 171 possibilities? (y or n)

which was a bit scary. Now, part of that was because I hadn't cleaned up 
the old git names, so I removed everything, and did a clean "make install" 
with the current git tree. At which point the question became

	Display all 105 possibilities? (y or n)

and pressing "y" shows a really nice list of programs.

Now, this is actually very convenient, and since I tend to install things 
in my own ~/bin directory, it's all good. What's a hundred files more or 
less?

However, doing a "ls /usr/bin/ | wc" shows that on my laptop /usr/bin is 
already 2583 files, and git is actually part of the problem there (hey, 
it's got the git RPM installed - it's not my main machine)..

Now, I happen to think that 2500+ files in /usr/bin is a bit much (ever 
try to use the horrid gnome executable finder on it when you want to 
convince firefox to use xpdf instead of that broken crap called "evince"? 
Takes absolutely ages and is horrible).

And git made it about 4% worse all on its own.

So I'd really suggest that while the "git-<tab><tab>" thing is perhaps 
useful, we'd actually be better off with an /usr/lib/git directory where 
we put the git executables by default. And just put "git" into /usr/bin.

That way, people who _want_ to use "git-<tab><tab>" can just add the git 
binary directory to their path and directly access all of them. And others 
can just use the plain "git" interface.

That would mean that I'd have to learn to use "git whatchanged" and "git 
diff-tree" instead of "git-whatchanged" and "git-diff-tree", but hey, it's 
why we have that "git" script in the first place.

What do people think?
