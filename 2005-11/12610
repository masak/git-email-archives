For some reason, my gut says that this goes too far.  I'm having a hard
time pinning down a way to explain that.

I guess something (untested) like this could do it, right before I call
git_commit_tree():

	my $found;
	do {
		$found = 0;
		if ($csets{$old}{comments} =~ /\s([a-f0-9]{40})\s/ &&
			exists $newcsets{$1}) {

			my $tcommit = $1;

			$found = 1;
			$csets{$old}{comments} =~ s/$tcommit/$newcsets{$tcommit}/g;
		}
	} while ($found);

I'm not entirely convinced this is a good idea, but there it is.

I'll write up a patch later for this (probably switching to GetOpt in
the process.)
