What happened was that I thought I'd apply after rewording the
sarcasm and maybe moving the existing table to the one in
technical/ (or just removing the old table), and forgot about it.

One thing I do not like the table in technical/ is that it is
harder to read as the "case table" than the original.
Admittedly, it is meant to describe more complex situation, so
it _is_ harder to understand, but a major difference is that the
original table was designed to decribe things orthogonally and
you did not have to read from top to bottom (any situation would
have fallen in one case no matter what order you checked the
condition for each case), while the updated table in technical/
_must_ be read from top to bottom and take the first match, and
that was what made me feel reluctant to remove the existing one
from the original document.
