Dear diary, on Tue, Nov 15, 2005 at 12:09:42PM CET, I got a letter
where Johannes Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de> said that...

I'm ambivalent here. I would like to have just a single behaviour here,
since the symbolic ref otherwise really does not get much testing. But I
can also understand that we are breaking tools here.

Still, for the reason above, I think we should aim at the symbolic refs
being the canonical format in the next major release after 1.0, giving
users time to fix their tools. I can see no advantage in symlinks except
the backwards compatibility - speed argument was presented, but I don't
buy that until I see hard data supporting that.

Yes, I would very much like to have this. I still want to go
symrefs-only for public repositories created for cg-admin-setuprepo, so
that fetching over HTTP works properly.
