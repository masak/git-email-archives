Is there anything in the directory structure that would be confidential?

Can you maybe provide the output of "git-whatchanged" (with no
parameters) or maybe

	git-whatchanged $commit1..$commit2 path/

Where $commit1 is a few commits before the problem, and $commit2 is a
few after it, and path/ is a path above the problem path?

You might add -m to that command line, too.

If the output of one of those commands, which will be commit objects +
tree differences, is less problematic, perhaps that would be easier to
share?
