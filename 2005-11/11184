My point (actually, my purist half's point) is that /usr/bin is
that nice structure that keeps related things together --- the
relatedness of them being "the end user would want to run them".
Your initial hesitation that the change being discussed would
force you to say "git whatchanged" when you are so accustomed to
type git-whatchanged is valid.  Unfortunately, we have far more
commands in /usr/bin than good old V7 days, and while the
_primary_ purpose of /usr/bin is to hold "the end user would
want to run them" things together (hence, shell needs to know
only about handful places to look at), having thousands of
things in one place is inconvenient for purposes other than the
primary purpose of that grouping (i.e. running them), such as
browsing them.

You could deviate from the UNIX tradition and "keep related
things together" in different ways; you _could_ have
/usr/bin/pdf-viewers/, /usr/bin/html-viewers/, etc. to hold
xpdf, acroread, firefox and iexplorer in them if you do not like
/usr/bin/ that has many executables -- but we do not do that.

I think that is a valid change.

Yes, but I think we should blame UNIX tradition for that ;-).

Sorry, my reply was prepared before I actually saw that patch
(you would notice it was a reply to your first message).  I
think what you did in your patch makes sense.  The end users
should always say 'git update-index' (or know the lib/git path
and it they want to say git-update-index), even when running the
low-level commands, and as long as they use 'git' wrapper that
approach would work.

> Yes. All porcelain would need to do the PATH thing, I think.

No, we could just say 'git commit' and 'git' is the only thing
that needs to know the PATH thing, as you did.

We _could_ even invoke 'git upload-pack' from 'git-fetch'.
