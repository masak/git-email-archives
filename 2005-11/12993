That's sounds very tempting to special-case for nested repos :)

Maybe use .git/objects/info/alternates in top-level repo? It may
have side-effects of the new objects ending up in top-level repo
if commited from top-level directory. Even then, the tools can
be tought to stop looking for GIT_DIR in the directory closest
to the file being commited:
  $ pwd
  .../top
  $ git-commit sub1/dir/file
  ... uses repo in .../top/sub1 instead of $(pwd)/../top/.git

Looks very messy, with a potential for lots of corner cases and
not that tempting anymore :(

Well, these are just lots of files. I can't really think of case were
I'd need to know about moving a directory without knowing what
happened to the files.
