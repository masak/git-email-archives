No, it wasn't.  It was designated on purpose to be ASCII-compatible, 
substring-safe, and minimally stateful.

Furthermore, it's extensible.  Although the original UTF-8 is limited to 
31 bits, and the officially published UTF-8 is further crippled to 21 
bits by Mirco$oft cronies who wanted it to be brainfuck-compatible with 
UTF-16, it could easily be extended to 64 bits or beyond.

I think it's *definitely* safe to say that whatever encoding we'll use 
in 2046, current UTF-8 will be a subset.  If you don't believe me, 
consider how long we've had ASCII and the first of the design criteria 
for UTF-8 that I listed in the first paragraph.
