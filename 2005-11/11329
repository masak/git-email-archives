Dear diary, on Tue, Nov 08, 2005 at 05:25:56PM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

But it should definitely be fixed. E.g. I actually personally use (for
Cogito development) git-core which I never make install (I have
system-wide git-core installation which is just whatever is the latest
version Gentoo ships, and I use that for non-Cogito development).
It would be painful if this mode of usage wouldn't be supported.
