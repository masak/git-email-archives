Then you could base your future development on 
NEW_HEAD_FOR_ARCHEOLOGICAL_PURPOSES.

You could still branch from GIT2, cherry picking from the patch to ORIG2, 
and then committing the successor based on GIT2, thus reinstating the 
hypothetical history.

Note: the history may be confusing, but ask any history teacher: history 
*is* confusing! It is all about people. If you want to make it less 
confusing, I am afraid you have to leave the path of true history.

But the GIT1..GIT_HEAD line was actually the correct history! Remember: He 
who forgets his past is doomed to repeat his mistakes! Don't pretend that 
the past was different than it was. It's not worth the hassle.
