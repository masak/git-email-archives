There's a "ptrlist" implementation in sparse, which does a very 
space-efficient implementation of arbitrary lists of pointers. It's also 
very CPU-efficient (in fact, thanks to being very cache-friendly, more so 
than the kernel list.h implementation) for most well-behaved operations 
(ie it's not hugely friendly to removal, but it's great for "add to end" 
and "traverse the list").

The ptrlist implementation is optimized for cases where the lists are 
usually shortish, but not trivial. So they are worthwhile if you expect 
the list length to be on the order of 5-10 entries rather than just 1-2 
(if you have just a couple of entries, the kernel lists are better). But 
perhaps more importantly, they are very space-efficient when the lists 
grow bigger (ie they average to just about 5% over the memory cost of a 
single pointer per list element for long lists).

Sparse in general is under the OSL license, but I'll happily dual-license 
the ptrlist thing, it's trivial and all my code (and I already checked 
with the person who did the list sorting code that we can dual-license 
that too).
