If the repo path is an URL, this works quite general. I tried
to avoid adding local head names to this remark...

Or better the .git/remotes namespace...
Still, this is misusing repo-local config for multiple repos.
Seems quite confusing for me.

git-mv would have to do exactly something like this to detect
inter-repo renames at all ;-)
But in general, this is really messy.

See my suggestion in a previous thread with similar topic
