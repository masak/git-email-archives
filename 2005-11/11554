Just trying to set up my public repository and test it. 

cg-clone http://www.chandlerfamily.org.uk/git/famtree.git new

When I get near the end the following happens:

http://www.chandlerfamily.org.uk/git/famtree.git/refs/tags/:
05:46:53 ERROR 403: Forbidden.

I suspect its trying to get a list of tags, but is the ":" part of the error 
message, or was that what it was trying to receive.

Does it require that apache serves the directories properly, because at the 
moment I have DirectoryIndex on these set to gitweb.cgi (although thats 
giving me 403 errors at the moment, hence my suspicions)
