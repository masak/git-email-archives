Ok, I didn't expect you guys to have 12k of files in your trees.  None
of your source trees are remotely close to that size (but I have many
more changesets).  I'm surprised you guys were able to put up
with Arch in the first place!

125m58.431s with my method.
  8m24.504s with yours :)

All of my usual source trees imported 1k changesets in 10-15 minutes

Patches on the way.

OTOH, the time spent importing the bulk of the history is a one-time
operation for most people and I'd much rather it get things as right as
possible and move on.

IIRC, there are several nasty cases all of which are ordering-related,
especially with regard to nested directories or file renames inside
directories that are also renamed.  It should be noted that not even tla
gets all the possible directory rename cases right (baz seems better
from my observations).

Sorry, I rushed through the initial overhaul and didn't generate neat
patches because I wanted to get some of my work moved to git ASAP.
