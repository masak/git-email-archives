That sounds like a backhanded way of saying that I'm micromanagering, 
picky and difficult to work with ;)

Hmm. True. The _really_ trivial in-index case triggers for me pretty 
often, but I haven't done any statistics. It might be only 50% of the 
time.

Is the recursive thing noticeably slower for the "easy" cases (ie things 
that the old regular resolve strategy does well)?

It's certainly an option to just do what I just did, namely use the 
default one until it breaks, and then just do "git reset --hard" and re-do 
the pull with "-s recursive". A bit sad, and it would be good to have 
coverage on the recursive strategy..
