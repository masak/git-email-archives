What do you mean by "have at least up to such and such commits" ? I
can see only one commit that they need: the one I used to create my
public repository...

That's a good idea. We get the same thing when cloning linux
repository. BTW how is it done in that case ?

Absolutely.  My question was not accurate sorry. It should have been
"can I have a public repository wiith fsck-objects unclean and with a
grafts file that should be downloaded when cloning it.
