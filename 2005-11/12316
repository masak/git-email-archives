... unless it was already utf8, that is.  I have received a
couple of patches with charset=utf-8; I think cte of them were
qp, which was a bit unpleasant.

Well, some people on the list seem to think UTF-8 is the one and
only right encoding, so for them if the message does not
identify what it is in, assuming UTF-8 and not doing any
conversion is probably the right thing ;-).

This suggests a few flags (config items) to mailinfo:

    (1) if we pass thru the input intact or not (1 bit);

    (2) what charset to assume if the mail does not identify
        itself (default to latin1; specify "barf" to mean abort
        processing if a message with 8-bit character does not
        identify itself);

    (3) what we do when the mail does not transliterate
        correctly (1 bit -- fail, or remove offending bytes and
        pretend things are peachy -- defaulting on the stricter
        side);
