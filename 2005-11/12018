First off, "rsync://" will never do what you want. It uses rsync 
(surprised surprise) to grab the objects, so since it has no clue what the 
objects are, it has no choice but to just grab them all.

Yes. Note that ftp.linux-mips.org does run the git daemon, so you can use 
"git://" instead of "rsync://" (that's how I pull from them when I sync).

Not having looked at that particular repo, I don't know. git can do it 
either way - either one long common history, or branches with totally 
unrelated histories. 

The fact that _some_ of the linux-mips repositories are based on mine 
makes me suspect that all their 2.6-based ones are rooted like mine is, 
but that may or may not be true.

Just try your above command line with "git://" instead.

(NOTE! Doing a full clone like the above is pretty expensive with git for 
the server side, so it might take a while before it starts feeding you 
stuff if it is under heavy load)

If you want to get rid of other branches, do:

	# Remove the branches
	git branch -D linux-2.0
	git branch -D linux-2.2
	git branch -D linux-2.4
	.. whatever other branches you don't want ..

	# Repack the repo
	git repack -a -d

	# Prune it all down
	git prune-packed
	git prune

and you should have a nice single pack that only contains the branch(es) 
that you're interested in.
