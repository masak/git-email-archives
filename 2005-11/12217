It is not in the official Cygwin distribution yet. Though I've started the
formalities, moving house as been taking all my spare time. So, the upgrade
worries would be for those people tracking the main git repo. As they are
almost certainly on this list, they should be aware of possible breakage.

I've noted some breakage with git-archimport, git-svnimport and git-cvsimport,
though i have not yet looked into it, some are due to the lack of necessary
tools under Cygwin. I'm re-jigging my distro script to emulate the new package
split and plan to distribute just the git 'core' stuff for the moment.

I was wondering if anyone has scripts that i could use to test the
svn/arch/CVS import/export for expected behavior?
