I think it's more confusing for the system to report Z differently from 
other things, because there's nothing special about what it found, except 
that Z happens to be last. I think it would be easiest to read as:

Rename A =>
  B (80%)
  C (85%)
  D (75%)
  ...
  Z (90%)

(Although I don't know if the results come out of the system sorted that 
way; obviously, if there are different removed things, mixing them 
together would be ambiguous in this format)
