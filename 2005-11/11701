This is most likley because the pack b3c6... contains unreachable objects.
git-pack-redundant only makes sure that all objects present in packfiles
still are present in packfiles after the redundant packs have been removed.

Thus, unreachable objects will also be considered as required.

Note that I haven't checked if this is the cause in this particular case,
but I have the same packfiles (I use the HTTP transport too).

I'm thinking of the possibility passing a list of objects to be ignored
on stdin to git-pack-redundant. This would hopefully solve this problem.
