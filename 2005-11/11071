I have a little problem I am trying to solve.  Tried a few things and got 
nowhere, so I thought I would ask here.

I have two directories one of which contains a tree of source code that was an 
original software package that I downloaded.  The other contains the result 
of some unfinished - but quite substancial changes that I had made to that 
source code.  Since this was some time ago, I don't have any records, but it 
is quite possible that I added and removed quite a few files.

I would like to make myself a git repository that contains at the start, an 
initial commit of the original downloaded source code, and a second commit on 
the top of that that contains the the current state of play after the changes 
I have made.

Since I don't actually have a list of the files, I thought I would establish 
these automatically by going into each directory and doing a cg-init.  So I 
now have two disjoint repositories each with their source tree in it.

My next thought was to add a branch to one of them and then pull the resultant 
code over and merge it using cg-branch-add followed by a cg-update.  But when 
I do that it complains that there is no common base.  

I tried creating an empty directory and separately merging the two versions 
with it, so that I have a common parent, but whatever I do, I can't get one 
of those nice little gitk diagrams that has any linkage between the two 
versions of the source code.

Is there an approach I could take to achieve what I want?
