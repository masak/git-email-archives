Well, git-merge-base does too. git-merge-base only takes two refs ;)

In general, you need to keep track of one bit per ref, and since we have 
a 32-bit "flags" word and need a couple of bits for other maintenance 
info, pretty much anything that figures out common heads will be limited 
some way. 

This is only a limit for the "and" logic - the "or" logic (if we implement 
it) will just share the same status bit for all the refs that are "ored 
together" and thus has no limits. 

Oh, and the "and" logic can be extended by running the program multiple 
times, so it's not a "hard" limit, it's just an issue of convenience.

That said, anybody who ever does an octopus of more than just a few heads 
deserves to be shot, so I don't think the limit should matter. The 
recursive strategy should only add the "or" kind of refs, and it 
shouldn't be a problem (apart from just how to describe them).
