heh.  in fact that is what my company (NetApp) requires.

then perhaps the problem is that the "stg mail" tool should place the 
author in the From: field automatically?  (ie change the tool, or 
permanently modify the default template that comes with StGIT to do 
this, as Catalin suggested earlier).

that seems a little twisty to me; you're overloading the SMTP header 
field instead of explicitly specifying patch authorship.  seems like a 
layering violation.
