That shouldn't be a problem because;
1) handle() dupes the connected socket to stdin and stdout, but not stderr.

2) A program sending output to stderr() fails (well, *should* be either 
failing or silent), so it's most likely not sane to continue doing 
things anyway. This assumes that no client prints anything to stderr 
that can be interpreted as "real" protocol data, ofcourse.

Sorry. I think I missed that part when I glanced at the diff output.
