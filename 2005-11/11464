Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 10, 2005 at 02:59:09AM CET, I got a letter

Then could you please separate those from the git completion to some
kind of 'library'?

When you do

bash happily autocompletes as well. I don't think this is a problem,
besides it can be useful when you want to use some existing branch name,
just slightly modified.
