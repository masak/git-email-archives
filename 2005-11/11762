One thing we could do is to push http-push out of the common
package and keep http-fetch.  I personally feel that the http
commit walker is as much core as gitk is.  If you are git://
capable that is great, and if you are git+ssh:// capable that
may be even nicer because you could push.  But let's face it:
there are always more pullers than pushers, and everybody can
talk http over his firewall.

Hmph.  This should have occurred to somebody when we did the same
with subprocess.py, but obviously it went unnoticed.

I am not so sure about that.  Why should the number of packages
matter?  We could argue that the current splitting of RPM
packages is half-done in that sense --- we lack the "tying
together" package which itself is empty but depends on
subpackages that implements common client-side.  Call that
git-scm (or "git") and have the end users install it, then it
would pull what it depends on along with it.  No?
