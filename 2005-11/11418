Dear diary, on Sat, Sep 24, 2005 at 08:10:40PM CEST, I got a letter

Point taken, you are right.

BTW, Cogito has for a while the command 'cg-admin-setuprepo' which is
designed to be used to create those public accessible repositories where
you typically only push to. Recently, I've also changed it so that it
just enables the default post-update hook; is it safe to assume that the
default template post-update hook shipped with GIT will be
good-to-be-autoenabled on public repositories and will always contain
the git-update-server-info invocation (unless it becomes irrelevant in
the future) ?
