Yes, convince the git maintainers, that it's incredibly stupid not to
enforce utf8 in commit messages. It makes absolutely zero sense in a
SCM, which merges forth and back between people around the world to
allow random encodings from the last century.

I still can't believe that this is a subject for discussion, in a
software developed in the year 2005.

With the next round of gitweb, I will substitute these caracters with
valid utf8, which will show up as invalid chars.

And git guys, please start to think again about your insane options,
that cause more harm than anything good.

Thanks,
Kay
