I bet somebody just messed up the index before that commit. So the commit 
probably _did_ modify the directory, though some incorrect patching or 
some scripting bug.

If you can guess at all what went on at around that commit (what else 
happened there?) that might help. Was it a merge? If those three files 
existed in the base commit of the merge but not in one of the branches, 
then the merge would have assumed that the branch just deleted it.

Is the tree public so that we can look at it and perhaps make a guess from 
what happened around it?
