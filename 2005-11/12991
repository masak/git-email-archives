Say it in another way: because currently, git commands only work in the
scope of one repository, there is no need to want to detect an
inter-repository rename.

Git has no explicit support for renaming, but can do it. Why should it
be a problem to write a tool which is able to detect inter-repository
renames? Still, such a search probably would be very expensive.

git-mv could support this. Additional to deleting from
one repository and adding to the new, it could generate a remark for
the commit message, like:

 Added file xxx is from remote repo '/path/myrepo' with name 'yyy'
 (file SHA1: 123445... from remote commit SHA1: 345667...)

This info could be interesting both for humans and a history browsing tool.
The tool still would have to know where to look for repo '/path/myrepo'.
It could also work for moving subdirectories (ie. trees instead of files).
