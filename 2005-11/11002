True. Although path isn't, strictly speaking, const char *, so perhaps 
that's what needs fixing. It's only ever called with path coming from 
argv, which isn't const. I can't really imagine anywhere where the 
repo-path might be const char * now that I think of it.

Actually *(slash + 1), but it amounts to the same thing I suppose. ;)

I looked around for indentation guide-lines but didn't found any, and 
the current code isn't exactly consistent about it. Perhaps it needs adding?

It could be "return current_dir();" immediately, I suppose. Would that 
be satisfactory?
