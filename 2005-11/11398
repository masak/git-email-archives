Why, thank you. :-)

Hey Junio,

I'm going to call "I told you so!" on this one! :-)

Where in I mumbled:

    I feel that an explanation of all of the behind-the-scripts-
    in-.git communication files is needed.  In particular these:

        FETCH_HEAD
        MERGE_HEAD
        LAST_MERGE
        MERGE_MSG

    These need to be mentioned and explained because they
    frequently form exactly the critical missing link or
    starting point after a failed fetch or merge.

You know.
