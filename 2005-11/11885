We have a (semi-experimental) wine.git tree, which is updated at the 
same time as the Wine CVS, by the project maintainer:

http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git

It will probably be maintained in parallel with the Wine CVS for a 
while, unless somebody writes a GIT->CVS gateway.

I find git-rebase to be particularly useful.  When I used CVS, sending a 
series of patches was a pain. I'd contemplated using quilt, but never 
got round to trying it.

Pushing patches from git into a drafts folder means I don't have to 
manually generate a diff, open a mail, type the mailing list address, 
attach the patch and write/copy-paste a ChangeLog entry.

"git pull" is usually sufficient.
