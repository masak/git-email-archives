That's git+ssh (not git transport protocol - this DID make a difference
at first, I know it's hard to believe) on machine A vs. rsync on
machine B.

rsync.kernel.org ("... official kernel.org hostnames for each transport.")


So I had this length more detailed benchmark which re-examined git+ssh
vs. git on master.kernel.org (good that git-daemon binds to
non-priviledged port). However, an embarrassing thing turned out - this
seems to be a network problem, actually.

 From kernel.org to machine X, it takes 20s, and from machine X to my
home machine, it takes 20s. From kernel.org to my home machine, it takes
5 minutes. This concerns only the git protocols, HTTP and SSH from my
home machine to kernel.org is fast as usual.  Even stranger, this is the
same for both hera.kernel.org and zeus.kernel.org, while each is at
totally different network.  Tried many times.  Ugh.

Well, so sorry for false alarm.

Your totally puzzled,
