I do not think so.  I have to admit I did not exactly agree with
the current behaviour when it was changed from the previous one,
but at the same time I did not have anything concrete against
it, and I did not care too much about the details back then.  I
suspect it was primarily be done to make things easier for the
end user without changing already existing tools (i.e.,
git-diff-files did not have to start taking --stage=2 flag to
tell it to compare stage2 and working tree).

This is the message from Linus that announced the current
behaviour:
