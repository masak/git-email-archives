Actually, you could. TWO ways, in fact, afaik.

Just use the "ssh://host/pathname" format (or just "host:pathname") and 
the GIT_SSH environment variable.

You could also override the local command-name with

	git-send-pack --exec=my-local-send-program /machine/repo/path

where the "my-local-send-program" will parse /machine/repo/path thing. At 
least that works with git-send-pack, but it's possible it doesn't work 
with some other logic (ie "git push" might decide that it's unhappy that 
/machine/repo/path doesn't exist locally because it thinks it's a local 
path).
