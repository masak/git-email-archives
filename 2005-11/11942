  Hi,

Dear diary, on Tue, Nov 15, 2005 at 01:55:16PM CET, I got a letter
where Jonas Fonseca <fonseca@diku.dk> said that...

Good idea. Perhaps even make this default for --help as well and offer
--long-help. cg-help would still default to the long help, unless -s or
something would be passed to it.

I prefer the second option and don't think it's much less clean. I think
it would be actually uglier the other way - strange without separating
empty line, too long with the separating line.
