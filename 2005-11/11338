Actually, the MIME attachment support in git means that I have to remove 
the "Content-Type: .. boundary: " line too when editing emails. 

I do all my patch validation in mbox format (which is why when you look at 
commit dates, you'll generally see a second or less between commits when I 
actually apply a mbox series), and the MIME format makes emails totally 
unreadable.

So I refuse to have anything to do with attachments and MIME types not 
because my tools couldn't apply the patches, but because I can't go 
through the patches manually sanely with them.

So I can do plain/text attachments, but they inevitably mean that I just 
have to edit the damn mailbox to make sense of it. Anything else (like 
base64-encoding or similar) I just refuse to touch.
