Sorry for the confusion.  The barebone Porcelainish shipped with
git-core does not fetch and store tags unconditionally under the
same name as the remote has without being told; you need to
explicitly tell it to 'git fetch --tags'.

What was added recently was a low level support for Cogito to
implement the automatic tracking.  This is supposed to (I do not
offhand know if the Cogito side has been updated to do so
already) work a bit differently.  Instead of grabbing all tags
and all objects reachable from them, as you fetch commits from
the remote, the automatic tracking fetches tags that point at
them.  What this means is that the tags on the remote branch you
are tracking would be fetched automatically but tags on a remote
branch you are not interested in are not.
