I should have dug it up. Apparently it's AUC-JP, not SJIS. 

Anyway. I literally have _no_ idea what the difference between those 
encodings are. I'm totally clueless when it comes to how the encodings 
actually work etc. I wouldn't know a Japanese character if it painted 
itself purple and did a risqué dance number.

But I do know just how slowly these conversions happen, and what a huge 
deal it is for people who have documents and tools and databases that are 
encoded in some particular encoding.

You do have to realize that while you may think that it's stupid that 
people use a non-utf8 encoding, those very people don't actually see a 
huge advantage from switching away from what has worked for them for 
decades, and they _do_ see huge transition pains and costs.

So let's say that you have a project where the coding style includes S-JIS 
or EUC-JP (of which there are multiple variations, I believe, just to make 
things even more fun). You could argue that if such a project moves into 
git, it should be converted to UTF-8 at that point. That's all fine and 
dandy, but usually you don't do flag-days. You have people who start 
tracking it in git, and maybe even developing it in git, but they still 
have to work with the outside people. 

Want to do on-the-fly conversion on CVS import (or worse yet - something 
like clearcase)? With magic rules or fragile heuristics for binary files? 
That's crazy, and that's not how these things work. No, the way these 
things work is that they continue to be maintained in EUC-JP or whatever, 
and a tool that requires conversion is a tool that just doesn't get used.
