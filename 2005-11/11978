wine.git hasn't been announced on any of the wine mailing lists yet.  As 
long as we don't get rid of CVS entirely, I don't think there'll be too 
many complaints.  Hopefully when it's announced, we'll have a few GIT 
users who can tell people why it's good to use.

git-cvsexportcommit looks nice.  I guess Alexandre is using something 
like that now.  I was thinking more ambitiously... something like a 
git-cvsd.  That would be a pretty awesome migration tool :)

No, there's no binary files in the Wine CVS (or symlinks ;).

I'll have a go at integrating my code with format-patch.  Hooks for a 
template would be helpful.
