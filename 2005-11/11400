No, ORIG_HEAD is pretty much it.

There's a few special files that a non-committed merge leaves around 
(either because you asked it to not be committed, or because it had 
clashes and requires manual fixing), but they are not normally useful to 
any regular people. You can poke around in the ".git" directory after such 
a merge if you want (MERGE_HEAD, MERGE_MSG).

ORIG_HEAD is _very_ useful, though, and I use it all the time. Any time 
you've pulled something from somebody else, and you wonder what you 
pulled, just go

	gitk ORIG_HEAD..

and you'll see exactly what new stuff you got in your branch. I often do 
that command line several times a day as I merge stuff. Otherwise the new 
stuff tends to be hidden in the noise.

(There's also FETCH_HEAD, which is the head of the last fetch, so if you 
aren't interested in any potential merge, you could instead use the range 
ORIG_HEAD..FETCH_HEAD, but quite frankly, I doubt anybody really cares 
except for the internal git fetching/pulling logic).
