There are versioning extensions to DAV, but they're not supported in all
implementations - for example, Apache's mod_dav only supports the
distributed authoring methods and that's what I've been testing with.
Pushing should work fine to a version-aware DAV server, although the
push should fail if the repository files are version-controlled (they
don't have to be, and it wouldn't make sense for them to be anyway.)
