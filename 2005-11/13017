This is not about your "bump", but one thing that may worthwhile
to try is bisect enhancements Linus did a couple of days ago, to
let you limit the number of commits tried by specifying the area
you are interested in.

If may not help if only thing you know is that i2c probe is not
what you are looking for, but if you know what area is suspect,
say arch/powerpc and include/asm-powerpc (just taken randomly, I
do not even know if you work in that area), it lets you say:

	$ git bisect reset
	$ git bisect start arch/powerpc include/asm-powerpc
        $ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc3
        $ git bisect bad master

What is interesting is that this cuts down the commits to be
inspected to only the ones that touch the specified paths.  So
without the path specifier, you may need to bisect 5000 commits in
total, but with the commits limited to the ones that touch these
two example directories, you would need to bisect 247 commits,
which is only a fraction of the original.
