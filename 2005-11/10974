I had an impression that DAV has its own notion of version
control, so using git as a backend on the server side might be
an interesting exercise.

Another solution for this would be to allow connect.c to use a
HTTP connect passthru proxy. CVS does this with an ugly but easy
to understand notation:

    ':pserver;proxy=firewall;proxyport=3128:user@host:/path/to/repo
