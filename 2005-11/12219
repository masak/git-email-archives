I've released another pre-release of my gitfs tool tonight.  The isn't a ton
of new functionality, but there has been a lot of changes:

  % for dir in gitfs-0.0[123]; do echo `cat $dir/*.[ch] | wc -l` $dir; done
  2228 gitfs-0.01
  2334 gitfs-0.02
  8276 gitfs-0.03

This is mostly because I've been working on taking it from the "proof of
concept" phase to a real filesystem.  To that end:

  * gitfs now does all git operations in a separate thread so accessing a
    large file won't cause other filesystem operations to stall.  In order
    to allow multithreaded operations we no longer use the libfuse API -- we
    speak the kernel/fuse API directly.  This was a lot of work but it's
    actually a much better fit for gitfs since it allows me to map directly
    between inode #'s and the internal "gnode"'s, saving a lot of work.

    Because of this you no longer need libfuse installed to use gitfs --
    all you need to compile is point the Makefile at a <linux/fuse.h>
    header -- the one that comes with a >=2.6.14 kernel will work fine.
    However, to actually mount a fuse filesystem you'll need the "fusermount"
    helper binary from fuse somewhere in $PATH

  * We use the sha1_object_info() API in current versions of libgit to
    avoid uncompressing blob objects if they're only being stat()'ed.
    This is another big speed-up

  * gitfs mounts now also create a UNIX domain socket so external clients
    can make requests (for instance to optimize things like "diff")
    Currently only a few simple commands are implemented, as described in
    the README

  * Lots of other infrastructure and data-structure work.  I'm particularly
    proud of my rather scary red-black tree implementation :-)
