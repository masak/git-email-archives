I think it is the right approach.  As I repeatedly said (not
that repeating things makes them right) on this list, I think
that the interpretation of what is in commit log is a policy
issue that is local to each project.

Pulls are "too late, sorry you have to live with it"; for
patches, mailinfo and am have -u (I do not remember if I added
it to applymbox -- I do not use applymbox anymore myself).
Maybe we should make -u the default and countermand with -U to
encourage the use of utf8 further?
