You catched me ;-)

Still I think my reasoning holds: cg-clone is also used locally, thus
cloning a repository on which you probably are working on, too.
If I want to branch off from master, I can use cg-clone to start a new
development branch. I suppose this is the suggested Cogito way, from
the README; and it makes Cogitos usage so simple, even with multiple
development branches: by using a cloned repository for each branch.

Of course, a Git user would use "git branch ...", and switch between
branches inside of one repository.
