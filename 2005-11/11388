Dear diary, on Tue, Nov 08, 2005 at 10:03:32PM CET, I got a letter

The world would be so much better if there would be just a _single_
per-file automerger instead of three right now...

I'm planning to feed back the automerger stuff from Cogito to GIT like I
already did once, but it's not a priority right now so it may take some
time (unless someone else does it, which is something I certainly
wouldn't oppose).

But in the longer term even the recursive merge should use the same one,
so either we should enhance the shell one to handle all the cases, or
split out the python per-file automerger from recursive merge and make
it possible to use this one separately. This is probably more viable
option in the longer term, even though I personally don't grok python
very well - whatever, at least I'll have to get better. ;-)
