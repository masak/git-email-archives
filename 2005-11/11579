Hmm. So what should I do with that? :-)

I wondered about adding multi-base merge support to Cogito, but it seems
to be a bit funny, and totally undocumented. Especially, is it right
that I would end up with _four_ stages in case of two-base "three"-way
merge? That would mean complete rewrite of the one-file merger, right?
And it seems git-merge-index would overflow and crash. :-)

I guess I really don't want to do that, but instead choose one of the
bases. Hmm. Well, I suppose it's as good as anything to leave this
decision on the user. Kind of:

	if [ $(wc -l merge-bases) -ge 1 ]; then
		echo "Multiple merge bases, please select one by the -b parameter:" >&2
		cat merge-bases
		echo -n "The most conservative base (but likely a lot of conflicts):" >&2
		while true; do
			git-merge-base --all $(cat merge-bases) >merge-bases~
			mv merge-bases~ merge-bases
			[ $(wc -l merge-bases) -eq 1 ] && break
		done
		cat merge-bases
		exit 1
	fi

Does core GIT have support for multibase merges, except for the
recursive merge strategy? How do you do it?
