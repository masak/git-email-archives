That file, with the so valuable (and so confusing) tables describing
the precise resolution rules git-read-tree follows, silently sat in
the corner and almost noone knew about it (well, I didn't, at least).
This references it from the git-read-tree documentation, so that there
is some chance that interested people will find it.
