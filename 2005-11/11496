I used git experimentally as I built a web application from scratch, learning 
both what I wanted the application to look like and how to do it with the 
packages I was using.  There is several hundreds of commits that are totally 
irrelevant (both because they were all different directions I was trying and 
then backing out of and because I saved state just were I was when I gave up 
for the day).

So what I was experimenting with was whether I could somehow get rid of that 
history (at least in one branch) before making that history public.

I know - I saw the warning - and I was only experimenting.  I just didn't 
understand what had happened.

I am now experimenting with another approach using grafts etc.  But I will 
post on that seperately, so as not to confuse titles of the e-mail thread.
