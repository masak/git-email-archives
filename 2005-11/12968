That may actually work really well. It would also avoid one bug that we 
have right now: if you fix things up by hand, but forget to explicitly do 
a "git-update-index filename" or "git commit filename", a plain regular 
"git commit" will happily commit all the changes _except_ for the ones you 
have merged manually. It's happened once to me.

If we left things in the index in an unmerged state, we'd be guaranteed to 
either _fail_ that git commit unless somebody has done the 
git-update-index (or names the files specifically on the commit command 
line, which will do it for you).

So I think I agree. 

Junio?

The problem (I think) was that "git-diff-file" did bad things with 
unmerged entries. That's what the comment in git-merge-one-file implies. 
But otherwise this should just make it so..

Do you want to test this out?
