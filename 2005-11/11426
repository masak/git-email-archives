Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 10, 2005 at 12:04:11AM CET, I got a letter

I'm not talking about mechanism but about the recommended policy (if you
have something better, fine, use it - just keep _one_ default one
instead of three, since this doesn't have anything or much to do with
the actual merge strategy). Besides,

what mechanism are you talking about? All the scripts have it hardcoded
what to use, it seems - cg-Xmergefile, git-merge-one-file or some
subroutine...
