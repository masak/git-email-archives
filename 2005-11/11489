Read Documentattion/tutorial.txt (and any relevent Documentation/howto/* files).

Search the archives.

If you still have problems, then the best format for questions here seems

Skipping step 1 can cause delays while people answer questions about
the specific micro-problems you had with the commands in step 2, when
the real answer is to use some totally different command.
