I'll run the clone/fetch/push test-suite again tomorrow, with this 
applied. It looks good though.

Not necessarily. The repositories in the whitelist should be validated 
(and possibly converted) using the path_ok() function. This will also 
make it possible to catch typos and permission errors that are just 
plain annoying for the admins.

In non-strict mode this isn't really a problem so long as all 
whitelist-paths are absolute and doesn't contain any symlinks, although 
we could use the chdir() + getcwd() thingie since we don't need the 
ability to go back to where we started and that's what will be used 
later when serving the repos.
