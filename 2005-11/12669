Obviously the same way as I did to try things out:

	$ LANG=en_US.utf8 DISPLAY=:0 gitk blah

That is not the point.  Point is that I think the user can use
LANG and LC_ALL (I suspect LC_CTYPE is what matters) to get what
you want, and I suspect hardcoding utf8 robs users the
possibility to deal with a repository that uses something else.

And as I suggested in another message (in the died-out thread
about gitweb), we could have i18n.commitEncoding in the
configuration to help gitk and gitweb.  I think that is the same
as your "other option".
