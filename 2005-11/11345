Dear diary, on Tue, Nov 08, 2005 at 08:30:10PM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

That's what I do.

Ah so. I see. Well, still useful when I'm changing something and I'm
lazy to remake after each change. ;-)

Either way, it should be consistent for all the scripts - either +x or
-x (but yes, definitely not a brown paper bag thing :).
