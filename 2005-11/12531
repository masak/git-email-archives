I was not talking about _your_ case specifically.  If you happen
to have based your partial history on top of a single commit
then the set of "such and such commits" might be only one, but
you could for example clone from Linus tip, merge in a couple of
jgarzik branch heads, put your own commits on top of them and
then cauterize your history, stopping at those foreign commits.
In such a case you obviously need to tell others where you
chopped your history off.
