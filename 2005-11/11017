I think we're talking past each other a little, partially because
I'm not sure exactly what features you want from revision control on the
patches.

But, my suggestion is to remember that once you add some sort of
revision control, people are going to want all of the features they are
used to with git/hg/their favorite SCM.  You'll probably get better
results if you patch git to your needs then if you try to reimplement
things all over again.
