This is cool! I used to track wine with "git-cvsimport -i".

My work flow was like this (not with wine, since I did not have enough 
time to hack on it in the last months, but with other CVS managed 
projects):

"git-cvsimport -i" every once in a while, followed by "git pull . origin" 
(my working branch is always master).

When I have something interesting, I make a topic branch from origin ("git 
checkout -b eyes_apple origin"), and pick the interesting commits from 
master ("git cherry-pick SHA1").

Sometimes I pick multiple commits with the "-n" flag, so that I can hide 
my shortcomings, committing with the message of the first commit ("git 
commit -C SHA1").

Then, I use git-format-patch to generate the patches, which I hand-edit to 
make sure there is no typo, and no unwanted changes slipped in. Then, I 
send the message(s).

It would be cool to have something like git-cvs-daemon, which simulates a 
CVS server.
