So, would this be considered legal or would it barf on baz?

foo		# No prefix
	bar	# tab prefix
        baz     # 8 spaces prefix

Most people have tabsize at 8. Some don't. Some editors insert spaces
instead of tabs while others don't. If we just match strings we'll
end up with users sending bug-reports by cut'n pasting their perfectly
valid-looking config which mixes tabs and spaces just because it's
been edited by people using different editors.

Real fun would be if the mta sends tabs as spaces. Then there'd
be no way at all of telling if the config *is* valid or not.
