Dear diary, on Mon, Nov 28, 2005 at 08:48:26AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...

Why? At worst you will get files with conflict markers on the server,
which isn't that huge problem and just what you have to expect when you
do this kind of thing. I could imagine having an option in the config
file describing whether the repository is "raw" or has the working copy
associated, and in the later case have the updating code in the default
post-update hook.

PS: If someone is bored, it would be very useful to have a manual page
for the git configuration file, containing the list of all options.
