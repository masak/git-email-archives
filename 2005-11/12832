It behaves sanely, just not in the way you are expecting.

Well, that is confusing, although it may be sane.

If you mean "in the presense of pathspec, default to -r", I
*might* agree, but I am not convinced yet.

Without pathspec, ls-tree is a pretty-printing version of
"git-cat-file tree", and that is how the command is used by the
git browsers like gitweb.  I have never looked at qgit source,
but I'd be surprised if it did not depend on the single-level
behaviour of ls-tree for that purpose.

It *is* "/bin/ls" after all, and you _would_ get annoyed if your
/bin/ls always recursed if you gave an argument.  Imagine going
to the kernel source and try "/bin/ls arch" with your version of
/bin/ls that always recurses, when you only wanted to get the
list of architectures you are supporting ;-).

Very true.  I do not think even git browsers need that but I may
be mistaken.

Having said all of the above, I do understand why we would
_also_ want the behaviour parallel to ls-files, not /bin/ls
behaviour.  Maybe we should have both?  Either rename the
current ls-tree to browse-tree, and make the one that parallels
ls-files the new ls-tree?
