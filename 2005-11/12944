I wouldn't know what to patch, having no clear picture of the approach
myself, and especially when I don't feel safe using the solution. For
example, how do you go about moving/renaming files between subrepos?
Rename detection will not work, which will be unexpected...

BTW, how does git-mv behave for out-of-tree renaming? How about
inter-repo renaming (remove+add)?

well, it ignored the ".git"s in the subdirs, not _the_ subdirectories.
I think that can be helped by putting the directories themselves into
.gitignore lists.
