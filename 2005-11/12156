It is not English but Gittish, which is fine, but it somehow
reminds me of the funny way users make themselves understood by
IF parsers ;-).  I am afraid you started small but now are going
towards the same insanity of gnudate (it has insane yacc grammar
to grok these things), and I suspect we'd better draw a line
somewhere.
