Disable USE_SYMLINK_HEAD by default.  Recommend using it only for
compatibility with older software.

Treat USE_SYMLINK_HEAD like other optional defines - check whether it's
defined, not its value.

Applying this patch before 1.0 may be controversial, but I think there
is a very good reason for that.  There should be exactly one git 1.0
repository format.  Now we have two that are present in the sources and
that have received testing from the git users.

Of those two formats, I prefer the one that is platform independent and
not very demanding with regard to filesystems and transfer protocols.
That format should be good enough so that we don't plan to change it as
soon as version 1.0 is released. Any third party software claiming to
support git 1.0 should need to support one repository format.
