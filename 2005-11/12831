Can I ask why you aren't willing to install packages, such as those?  I
can understand a reluctance to install modules directly from CPAN, on an
otherwise package-managed system, but I'm afraid I must confess to
puzzlement over a reluctance to use pre-packaged modules.

The major flaw in git-send-email, from my perspective, was a lack of
support for SMTP AUTH, for situations like Junio's, where the local MTA
(and thus "mail" as well) are not configured to handle SMTP AUTH. Moving
to a purely shell based replacement seems to make this an even harder
feature to support.  (Though, admittedly, I haven't even made an attempt
to add it to the Perl version yet.)

Fair enough.
