I understood that; actually, when I found it, a number of the ALT cases 
had been implemented, and some of them supplimented rather than replaced 
the originals.

The hard thing is to verify that all the subcases are listed. I switched 
the orders of matching and non-matching, so that I could make it matching 
and need-not-match. Your table is actually missing a few cases: what 
happens if O is missing, 2 has a directory, and 3 has a file? You note 
that we have to be careful, but don't list the result (which is "no 
merge").

Perhaps the table would be clearer if the lines were grouped in 
exists/missing? (With 5ALT repeated in the 011 and 111 groups, since it 
applies to both) Then you would only need to look at 5 lines with 
cascading (in the most complex case), rather than having to read the whole 
top of the table.

(It is actually written like that, with the exception of 5ALT, 2ALT, and 
3ALT, but it's not visually obvious.)

So case 11 is really: All three exist. Head and remote don't match 
(-5ALT), no ancestor matches remote (-13), and no ancestor matches head 
(-14). Case 13 is really: All three exist. Head and remote don't match 
(-5ALT), there aren't different ancestors which match head and remote 
(-16), and an ancestor matches remote.

The tricky bit is really cases 2ALT and 3ALT, which can be used in cases 
where some but not all of the ancestors are empty, and can't be used if 
there's a directory/file conflict; neither of these conditions matters for 
anything else in the table, so it's hard to fit this in. My strategy is to 
have those as special cases, and have the rest of the table cover 
everything (rather than having case 2 require a directory/file conflict 
and case 7 require that no ancestor be empty, which would be accurate, but 
would make it harder to check for missing cases).
