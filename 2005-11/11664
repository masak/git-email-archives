I've cooked up a patch that takes care of this if;
	git daemon
is executed (rather than git-daemon). Otherwise we could just mention in 
the docs that git-daemon must be run with the --libdir parameter (or 
whatever we decide to call it). If it prepends the libdir to the path 
everything will work same as always in the rest of the code so it'll be 
a very small change.

All I really need to finalize it is that name, so It's up to you how 
fast you want it. Perhaps we could take a poll?

The suggestions so far come from the threads "git binary directory?" and 
"[PATCH] C implementation of the 'git' program" and some I just thought 
up. And here are the nominees;

	libdir
	path
	exec-path


Kay Sievers pointed out that libexec is not "LSB conformant" so it might 
be going away and is thus not listed.

exec-path was the last suggested name I got from Junio.

The form will be
	exec_path=$(prefix)/lib/git-@@VERSION@@
	GIT_EXEC_PATH
	--exec-path

for Makefile, environment and 'git', respectively. Substitute the 
obvious part with whatever you prefer.

Sounds sensible, although I'm implementing Linus' idea of prepending the 
GIT_EXEC_PATH to $PATH so the porcelainish scripts in git-core shouldn't 
have to do it. If someone executes git-<script> from command-line I 
think it's safe to assume that they've added the exec-path to $PATH 
themselves. Someone *might* run

	/usr/lib/git-$GIT_VERSION/git-<script>

which should be cautioned against in the documentation.
