Project global configurations could be:
- .git/info
- .git/hooks
- default for encoding of commit messages
- relationship of public project branches (perhaps access rights)
- project description, maintainers, public branch descriptions
- central repository URL
- ...

Hmm.. this even could be seen as another level: origin specific

That doesn't work well with configuration which should be global to the
whole history of the original project, e.g. .git/info/exclude, or maintainer
information.

Project configuration probably always should be up to date, so:
* always update when fetching/pulling project branches
* always push when pushing project branches
