That's bad. Your new pack should contain some objects not present in
the older packfiles and thus it shouldn't be removed, unless there
were no new objects to pack. 

If no new objects were packed, the sum of the old packs might be smaller 
than the new superpack, or the old packs could contain unreachable objects,
which makes git-pack-redundant unable to detect that they should be removed.

Could you try updating to the latest snapshot? There was a bug in a
list handling function which was fixed recently, perhaps your problem
is related.
