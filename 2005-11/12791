Dear diary, on Sun, Nov 27, 2005 at 10:21:53AM CET, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...
>  - cg-admin-cat may want to use -r for the first one (${ARGS[@]}

I think the current behaviour is nonsensical, since it cats all the
files in the subdirectory, instead of just listing it. Didn't
git-ls-tree already have the -d implicit sometime in the past? At any
rate, the change to git-ls-tree would fix this. :-)

Thanks, fixed. It uses -r now.
