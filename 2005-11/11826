So I got a question about ppp in the kernel, and quite frankly, the things 
I know about ppp can be engraved with a jack-hammer on a grain of rice.

So what did I do?

	git whatchanged $(git-ls-files *ppp*)

actually does something useful. It will only look at files that are 
_currently_ called *ppp*, so you'd not see files that have been deleted, 
but it does the right thing for what I wanted.

You can also do "git log" or "gitk" instead of "git whatchanged", but the 
whatchanged thing has the advantage that it can run incrementally. Doing a 
"git log" ends up figuring out _all_ the commits before it can display 
them, since it also does the densification etc.

Maybe we should have a git man-page section of "strange but useful 
examples"? Things people do just because they are useful, but may not be 
immediately obvious to somebody who comes from CVS-land and uses git as 
just another old SCM?
