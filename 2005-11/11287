This is the first time I see you pleased by something in git
that was done without very close supervision from you.  All the
credits for this one goes to Fredrik, of course, but it is a
small victory for me as the maintainer as well, and I am very
happy about it.

Another thing to consider is if it is fast enough for everyday
trivial merges.

In any case, I've been thinking about teaching git-merge to look
into .git/config to make it overridable which strategy to use by
default.  This would eliminate the hardcoded 'resolve for
two-head, octopus for more' rule from git-pull.  Then we could
ship git-merge with the default rule of 'recursive for two-head,
octopus for more', and if it turns out to be premature, you can
update your config file to use resolve for two-head case while
we sort things out.  That way, recursive would get wider test
coverage, and people who really need a working merge this minute
can choose to run resolve in emergency without specifying '-s
resolve' on the command line of 'git pull' every time.
