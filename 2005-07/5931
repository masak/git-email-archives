Yes. Maybe we could relax that requirement by using "./git-tar-tree" or 
something? That still requires that you have _built_ git to do the rpm, 
but at least you won't have had to install it.

Does that fit the rpm build process? Or does an rpm build make something 
like that really inconvenient? I don't know, patches welcome.

Most people don't have asciidoc, and I'm not sure we want to require it. 
Maybe we could have a separate "make man-rpm" target for that?

Ok, why is debian problematic? Is there some missing dependency or 
something? I really haven't ever done an rpm, and the git rpm target was 
all done by Chris Wright, so I don't have any clue at all. Again, patches 
welcome.

I'd really actually prefer for the code to be shared with the commit code, 
so that the user info (name, email, date) would not just be exactly the 
same, but would share the same code so that we don't end up having them 
ever get out of sync. 

That would imply moving parts of "git-tag-script" into mktag.c.
