Since it can be run as a sequestered user, and we now have plenty of CPU 
horsepower on the download servers, it seems like it should be an 
entirely sane thing to do.

Is this thing meant to be run from inetd, or is it a "listen and fork" 
daemon?  Especially the latter case, it absolutely *have* to have 
protections for:

- "SYN and run" DoS attacks;
- Too many connections from the same IP;
- Too many processes running total.
