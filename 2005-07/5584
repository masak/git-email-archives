That's right. Well, for everything but the short id matching we could
just check the ID validity by git-rev-parse instead of peeking into
the object store - I just did that. If I'm not missing anything, that
will just make the short id matching for packed objects impossible, but
works fine otherwise...?

I feel reserved about that. I want to have custom error handling here to
give the user less confusing output (no core GIT command name, since
that confuses users), and as I said, Cogito's rev resolving is more
powerful than Core Git's.

> The only thing missing is the short id matching.

Yes, but as I said, I think it's very important to have. BTW, another
cool thing cg-Xnormid does and git-rev-parse does not: time specifiers.
E.g. you could specify revisions as "2 days ago" or so, very useful for
cg-log, cg-diff and such.

Thanks for pointing this out, BTW.
