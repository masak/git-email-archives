I personally do not have preference either way, but am slightly
biased towards the "cumulative" behaviour the patch attempts to
implement, which was what Pasky said he wanted to have.

    Yes. There were several discussions about this in the past, with no
    clear outcome, IIRC. I would prefer:

      ~/.git/ignore per-user
      /.git/ignore per-repository
      .gitignore per-directory (cummulative with parent directories)

Your saying "fine" is a relief.  This change aims at helping
Porcelain people by making it less likely for Porcelain to need
its own filtering.  As you say, if ls-files filters more than
the Porcelain wants, that's a bigger problem.

I do not know, either, but I do know it is consistent with the
"first match determines fate" rule and cleaner to implement.
