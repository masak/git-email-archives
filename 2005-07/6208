This is a resend of my previous set of patches.

I have updated these patches with Junio's suggestion.

I have also added some documentation, a simple README.osx.

Once you have applied these patches, could you choose one of these 4
options, Junio?

1) send me the result of "make Portfile" on next release
2) attach the result of "make Portfile" to
http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3949 on next release
3) upload Portfile's along with the .tar.gz's.
4) tell me you're doing none of the above's, and I'll do the process
manually.

2 of these 5 patches are unchanged from the previous post.  I have
attached them anyways to maintain the series.  Please let me know if
this is poor etiquette.

thanks,
Bryan
