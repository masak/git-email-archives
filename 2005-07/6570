Ok... so lets check my assumptions:

1. Pack files should reduce the number of http round trips.
2. What I'm seeing when I check out mainline git is the acquisition of a
single large pack, then 600+ more recent objects. Better than before,
but still hundreds of round trips.
3. If I wanted to further speed up the initial checkout on my own
repositories I could frequently repack my most recent few hundred
objects.
4. If curl had pipelining then less pack management would be needed.

Where is the code for gitweb? (i.e. http://kernel.org/git ) Seems like
it could benefit from some git-send-pack superpowers.
