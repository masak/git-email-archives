I had the following situation: in a throw away tree I made some changes.
The last conflicted with a change I pulled from somewhere else into the
master, and the best solution was to revert that last change from the
throw away tree. Basically, the result of the merge was identical to
master, i.e. git-status says "nothing to commit". I wanted to document,
however, that I do not want that change from the throw away tree in my
master, even if I keep it in the throw away tree.

I am no longer sure if that was a good thing to do, maybe I should have
fixed it in the throw away tree by merging master there. Or, alternatively
git-commit could check for "nothing to commit" OR "MERGE_HEAD exists".
Dunno.

Ciao,
Dscho
