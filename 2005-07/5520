Dear diary, on Fri, Jul 01, 2005 at 03:56:06PM CEST, I got a letter

I don't know, I don't consider this very appealing myself. I'd rather
prefer the private tags to be per-repository rather than per-user, since
those ugly "merged-here", "broken" etc. tags aren't very useful on
larger scope than of a repository. OTOH, what tags would be per-user,
not per-repository and not global?
