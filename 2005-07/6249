Dear diary, on Fri, Jul 15, 2005 at 02:46:42AM CEST, I got a letter
where Fredrik Kuivinen <freku045@student.liu.se> told me that...
> Hi,

Hello from a lazy reader who didn't actually try it,

> Gct v0.1 has been released and can be downloaded from
> http://www.cyd.liu.se/~freku045/gct/gct-0.1.tar.gz
> 
> What follows is an excerpt from the README in the tarball:

> Introduction
> ------------
> 
> Git Commit Tool or gct is a simple GUI enabled Git commit tool. It
> allows the user to select which files should be committed, write
> commit messages and perform the commit. It also has some support for
> controlling the synchronisation between the Git cache and the working
> directory.

do you have any screenshots please? From the description it appears it
is actually not any more powerful than cg-commit. Does it let you see
the diff, actually prune the changes to be committed and such?
