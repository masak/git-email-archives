  Hello,

  I don't expect anyone but myself to actually follow git-pb, but just
in case - I rebased it against the latest Linus' HEAD since its history
was becoming rather dirty, rusty and generally undesirable to merge for
anyone. So if you will try to update, you will end up with tree merge
and you don't want to do that, so

	cat .git/refs/heads/origin >.git/refs/heads/master
