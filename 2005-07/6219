I have also been disturbed.  But I am gratified that such a core git 
personage shares my concern.   This is enough from a technical point of 
view, at least for me.

Any lack of porcelain momentum is probably due to git having better 
documentation than the current porcelains, such as cogito and stacked 
git.  The documentation, like tutorial.txt and Jeff Garzik's git kernel 
howto give the impression that most kernel folks use git instead of cogito.

I personally think that the cogito interface and stacked git interfaces 
are much nicer than git's, and would like to see these two tools achieve 
some momentum.

Another way of encouraging porcelain is by helping Pasky and Catalin 
out.  Myself, I have been sending corresponding patches for Cogito  and 
Stacked when making changes to git.  This is purely selfish: I use both 
of these porcelains, but if it became general practice, we'd probably 
see less breakage.
