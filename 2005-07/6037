Use

	make MOZILLA_SHA1=1

to use the included mozilla-based SHA1 library.

(Or just do "export MOZILLA_SHA1=1" in your .bashrc so that you always do 
this).

There's also a "PPC_SHA1" which works the same way, and which enables the 
optimized ppc assembly language version. It used to make a big difference 
for me, but it seems modern openssl libraries already have something 
fairly optimized (on my YDL machine the openssl version was really slow).
