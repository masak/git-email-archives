  Hello,

  I'm happy to announce the release of the 0.12 version of the Cogito
SCM-like layer over Linus' GIT tree history storage tool. Get it at

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/

or cg-update if you have an older version cloned.

  I wanted to release it later with more cool features, but after all
releasing often is good and people will get to test things more, and
I wanted to make it possible for kernel.org to upgrade to newer RPM.
But it may not be as stable as I'd wish and may have some rough edges,
so be warned.

  This release contains the latest stuff from Linus, with all the
packing stuff and everything. Other things include heaps of bugfixes,
enhanced options parsing, ~/.cgrc support, cg-push, real cg-tag, and
plenty of smaller but nice stuff. And more to come in next days!

  About cg-push, it:

  (i) works only locally or over git+ssh branches

  (ii) the head updated on the other side must be 'master' too
	(high priority to fix)

  (iii) the head updated on the other side is re-created, thus losing
	all attributes (ownership, permissions)
	(high priority to fix)

  (iv) won't update the remote working tree if there is any associated
	with the repository - do cg-cancel to catch up, but that will
	lose any local changes you did (note that I plan to rename
	cg-cancel to cg-reset)

  Also, I've deprecated rsync, as I explained in another mail. Use
cg-branch-chg to change the branch URLs to some more sensible scheme -
most likely HTTP, or SSH if you want to push as well.

  Have fun,
