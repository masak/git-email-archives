Thanks for the constructive comments; that patch was only a draft, and 
tailored for my needs. I thought it would be better to provide a patch than 
requesting for a feature.

I am trying to convert a CVS project with a few developers to GIT; the idea is 
that each developer has his public branch in *the* central repository, and 
(s)he is allowed to merge to master him/herself; when pushing new features 
into the branches or merging to master, there should be send out a mail to a 
mailing list.

I didn't know this...

I actually thought that the ancestor relationship always is given; perhaps we 
don't need to enforce this; but before sending out a mail, the hook script 
probably would like to check if there is any ancestor relationship; this 
would be a potential long lasting task, wouldn't it?

Sorry, I do not understand this.

Good question. I thought it is UNIX/POSIX behavior to set this environemt in 
shells (same as "id -u -n"). At least, ssh sets it to "the user logging 
in" (see man ssh).
And I supposed "git-receive-pack" to be called in a users SSH environment.
Hmmm... could this be called via CGI script by a web server?

You are right: we should be careful here. Is there any other hook mechanism in 
GIT at the moment? Originally, I thought this should be a task for a 
porcelain, but this thing is buried too deep in GIT itself...

All the issues about documenting the environment of the hooks, time out 
behavior and so on, are general issues for every kind of hook.

I think that a time out is not needed here: as the hook is called synchronous, 
git-receive-pack won't return without until the hook terminated. And that is 
visible to the user, i.e. he would see that there is something wrong.

This is no coincidence ;-) I copied it from inside the same file.
But the behavior is another: If the hook goes wrong, I do not want for 
git-receive-pack to die.

Probably.

Do you have a use case? At least, it would make things more complex.
