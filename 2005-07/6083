except there are a number of places I need to frob things in Cogito
and they are not all for the head.  If the head is special and the
only candidate sure, that works for me.

I already stated that wasn't supposed to work.  If you have symlinks
outside of your tree with cogito I think there is a *lot* more code
that probably needs to be checked.

Remember I used cogito here, not git directly.  That probably means
things are invoked very differently for me?

Possibly, I was more for RFC/concept reasons I posted the patch.  I'm
clueless when it comes to writing decent or reliable bash sh/bash
scripts.
