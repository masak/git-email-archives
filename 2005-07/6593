That description makes it sound more like it is a Cogito
specific hack, which other Porcelains may not benefit from,
meaning they may want to suppress some other errors but this
patch does not give that possibility.

I do not mind about the above too much, but I'll sit on this one
for now just in case if anybody comes up with a different patch
to give a bit cleaner solution.

I wonder how many die()'s we have in our C code.  It _might_ be
cleaner to say (the first parameter being exit(2) parameter):

    die("unable to execute '%s'", pgm);
    die_with(47, "merge program failed");

and have the calling Porcelain, if it wants to, supress error
messages by redirecting 2>/dev/null, and say whatever it wants
to say based on $?.
