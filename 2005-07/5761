Have you not looked at tla/arch? tla does supports dumb servers.
It's job is a little easier as it has one file per atomic commit
I suspect once packs start working well that should not be an
issue for git either.

For small projects this is a major benefit, as they can just push
their files to a convenient http or ftp server.

For optimizing network bandwidth that sounds like the way to go.  For
adhoc development I don't know.  For a central sever you still need
an authenticated way to push content, which makes it another dimension
of the problem.  So it is mostly a question of what is the sanest way
to mirror/publish data.  http is used a lot for publishing data and
practically everyone has access to a http server that can host
content, so I think supporting http makes git a lot more accessible
to people.  The only thing more accessible seems to be email, and
email is terrible for publish small projects.
