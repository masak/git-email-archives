I think that would be a reasonable thing to do.  The server for
anonymous puller, git-daemon, may need some extending.  As
people criticised, git-upload-pack/git-fetch-pack protocol being
not easily extensible, we would end up doing another protocol,
though, that's OK.

Fortunately [*1*], git-daemon itself is written to be extensible
if you are willing to introduce a totally new protocol driver,
so if this on-demand pack generation turns out to be too much
a resource hog, we have a reasonably easy way out.


[Footnote]

*1* We are fortunate but that is not by dumb luck.  When he did
daemon.c::execute(), Linus must have thought things through.
