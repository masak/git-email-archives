Did you actually think I suggested you to make that into a
script that cannot be configured?  No, it was Junio acquiring a
habit from Linus to give a rough outline in a code form in his
e-mail client.

In another message, you said:

I thought so but then I tried it and actually it does seem to
work as expected (well, it is Linus code so it has to be perfect
;-).  I created an empty directory and ran the following script.
It creates two commits, tags the later commit to
".git/refs/tags/one", and shows the list of objects the
upload-pack (the peer git-fetch-pack talks to) decides to pack
and send to the puller that has the first commit only.  The
first git-rev-list shows one extra object compared to the second
one; the difference is the named tag that is being asked.
