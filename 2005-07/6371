Oh, and btw, maybe you didn't realize that "git-ls-files --others" already 
basically does what your script does? Without any filtering - it was meant 
to be run from a script, so something like

	for i in $(git-ls-files --others)
	do
		if [ ! match_ignore "$i" ]; then
			case $(file -b $i)
			ELF*)
				;;
			*)
				echo $i
				;;
			esac
		fi
	done

was what I was thinking of.
