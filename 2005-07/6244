Dear diary, on Fri, Jul 15, 2005 at 06:12:48AM CEST, I got a letter
where James Cloos <cloos+vger-git@jhcloos.com> told me that...

Huh. Well, you had to do uberweird things with your repository - why did
you cg-seek at all? What Cogito version is it?

Anyway, cg-reset (or cg-cancel in "older" Cogito) should bring
everything in shape.
