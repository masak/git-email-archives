I really question removing rsync before HTTP pulls become more 
effecient.  I did a complete pull of cogito from kernel.org, and http 
took over 50 minutes to pull everything, while rsync was done in just 
over 1 minute.  I dared not even try to pull the full kernel at that speed.

I suspect that part of the problem is that the pull methods are doing a 
depth first search, so we can't request the next object until the 
current object is fully received and parsed.  Changing to a breadth 
first search would allow multiple requests in flight and asynchronous 
processing which should speed things up.  I am exploring using the 
curl_multi_* functions to do this, but this will require changes to 
common code in pull.c.
