No, that could be done.  It's not the rpmbuild at that point, it's just
prepping to do the rpmbuild.  It's only an issue for those that are trying
to build an rpm directly from the git source and who've never installed
git before.  Doesn't seem necessary to me, I'm not that fond of it (will
even slightly slow down make dist process if it's done from a clean,
i.e. make clean, dir), but hey...the trivial patch below does this.

Heh debian rpm build...I missed that bit in Eric's message.  Eric, care
to give details?

thanks,

Use git-tar-tree directly from git source during make dist.  This
handles bootstrap issue with git not being installed.
