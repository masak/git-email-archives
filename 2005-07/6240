These all sound good.  Along the lines of #4, one potential purpose I've
been curious about is the possibility of pulling these core operations
out into a library that Porcelain could use directly.  This way,
Porcelain, including the minimum git UI (your #1), could directly link
in and call the needed functions, and rather than stringing sequences of
git-whatever commands together in a shell script.

This would allow Porcelain to take advantage of the core git more
directly, and would improve the speed of Porcelain.  The minimum UI (#1)
would be a much simpler example (#3), since it would only be the
front-end, rather than the front-end/back-end combination it is now.

Is this something we want to consider, or am I out in left field? :)
