I have been looking at send-pack because some people seem to
want to push into a remote repository that names heads
differently from local.  I have some questions that do not have
to do with anything about their request, but about what
the current code intends to do.

 * Right now, "send-pack --all" into an empty repository does
   not do anything, but "send-pack --all master" into an empty
   repository pushes all local heads.  This is because we do not
   check "send_all" when deciding if we want to call try_match
   on local references.  I am assuming this is an oversight; am
   I correct?  If so, does the attached patch look OK?

 * It appears to me that you can say "send-pack net", and
   depending on how the remote lists its refs, you can end up
   updating their refs/heads/net or refs/tags/net.  More
   confusingly, you could say "send-pack net net" to update
   both.  More realistically, you could get confused with a
   remote that has refs/heads/jgarzik/net and
   refs/heads/dsmiller/net in this way.  I think it should
   detect, stop and warn about the ambiguity and require the
   user to be more explicit.  Am I reading the current code
   correctly?

   I've always _hated_ the interface to path_match() which
   pretends to be just a boolean function but actually has a
   grave side effect, by the way.
