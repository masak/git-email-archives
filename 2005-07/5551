?? Isn't that what ssh is?

To some extent a lot depends on how active you expect people to
try and forge things.  If there is an expectation of honesty
you are fine.  

If you want to build one mondo repository with thousands of developers
having write access you need to be more careful.  But as far as I know
none of that is specific to tags.
