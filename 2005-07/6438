I was using vanilla git, as of 10 minutes before I sent the email.  Top 
of tree is 154d3d2dd2656c23ea04e9d1c6dd4e576a7af6de.

Poor example...   sure it opens a socket, but X certainly does have a 
special case local path (mit shm), and they're adding more for 3D due 
the massive amount of data involved in 3D.

Well, I'm not overly concerned, mostly curious.  The pack+unpack step 
(a) appears completely redundant and (b) is the step that takes the most 
time here, for local pulls, after the diffstat.
