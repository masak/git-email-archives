Well, that would certainly be possible. Just having a flag that disables 
"mark_tree_uninteresting()" would do it.

It doesn't impact the delta algorithm, because the objects are sorted by 
type first, so it never mixes up trees and commits.

But if you wanted to, something like this would be cleaner than your 
suggestion..
