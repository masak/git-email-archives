Dear diary, on Fri, Jul 22, 2005 at 12:37:05PM CEST, I got a letter
where Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@gmail.com> told me that...

This unfortunately isn't that simple, since this file substitutes only
the

	CG: -----------------------------------------------------------------------
	CG: Lines beginning with the CG: prefix are removed automatically.

snippet of the file. The trouble is, Cogito autogenerates most of the
rest of it. Would the acceptable solution be that I would have
@CG_FILELIST@-style placeholders there, and any tool processing the
file would simply drop lines containing @ directives it does not
understand? (@@ is escaped @)

I have nothing against changing the prefix to GIT:.

Then, Cogito's default commit-template would look like

	GIT: -----------------------------------------------------------------------
	GIT: Lines beginning with the GIT: prefix are removed automatically.
	GIT:
	GIT: Author: @AUTHOR_NAME@
	GIT: Email: @AUTHOR_EMAIL@
	GIT: Date: @AUTHOR_DATE@
	GIT:@CG_SHOWFILES@@CG_NOMERGE@
	GIT:@CG_SHOWFILES@@CG_NOMERGE@ By deleting lines beginning with GIT:F, the associated file
	GIT:@CG_SHOWFILES@@CG_NOMERGE@ will be removed from the commit list.
	GIT:@CG_SHOWFILES@
	GIT:@CG_SHOWFILES@ Modified files:
	GIT:@CG_SHOWFILES@F   @FILELIST@
	GIT: -----------------------------------------------------------------------
	GIT: vim: textwidth=75

(where CG_SHOWFILES is defined only when the list of the files is to be
shown and CG_NOMERGE only when there is no merge going on).
