Dear diary, on Fri, Jul 22, 2005 at 11:53:41PM CEST, I got a letter

I think that is a bad idea. Suddenly, you do not have the two things in
the same timeline, which may be quite confusing especially in case of
some hooks which depend on the contents of the tree of the project
itself, in case of commit templates and such.

Yes, but this stuff is not for personal preferences. It is for
project-wide preferences and policies, which can be still normally
overridden or altered locally in each repository.
