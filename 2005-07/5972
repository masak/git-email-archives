That would be sane.  The reason I worry about having it installed is
that if git-tar-tree changes without building first you will run
the old version instead of the new one.

Or just have a make man target and only require the rpm to use it.
You certainly want to require making the man pages when building
the rpm.  Which means only those people who build rpms or build
man pages need asciidoc.

Mostly because debian is not rpm based.  If you are real careful
you can build rpm's on debian.   It is almost as bad as complaining
that git does not build on windows with Microsoft's compiler.  I was
getting a really generic error.  I need to look into it deeper to see
if is something that is avoidable.

Will do.
