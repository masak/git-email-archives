Looking at the set of patches we just all dumped on Linus, I think they
pretty much show us that we don't have any major issues.

As I see it, the status is currently like this:

Revision control - Stable
Pulling locally or over rsync - Stable
Pushing over ssh - Stable

Remote, anonymous pulls not using rsync - Beta
Usability features[1] - Beta

Documentation - Alpha

My feeling is that we're pretty well set to do a 1.0 release.

1 - Usability features are all the things around git-apply,
git-format-patch, etc, that we're clearly working on to make life more
pleasant, but aren't really critical.
