Heh. It really is personal.

The new git-pack handling tries to avoid special characters, because it 
passes some things off to a shell (ie it opens up an ssh connection.

But yeah, it's being a bit too anal. Just look at connect.c: shell_safe(),
and add both '_' and '@' to the safe list (and any other safe characters),
and off you go.

And if somebody wants to add code to do proper escaping of the non-safe 
ones, we can do that too. I was just lazy and added the characters I ever 
use ;)
