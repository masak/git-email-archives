The real question is why you would even want to do that.

Managing multiple heads and making sure which one is which even
on a single repository is a mental burden, at least to me.  When
you can name local and remote differently, the name mappings
also need to be managed in addition to that.  Yes, the mappings
can be automated by Porcelains, but that means we need to have
another configuration item around (which needs to be compatible
across Porcelains) to achieve that flexibility, but what does
that flexibility really buys you?

My gut feeling is that Johannes is right here, at least about
the send-pack side.  Storing "master" pulled from a remote under
a name different from the remote is a different story.  I do not
have much problem with that.
