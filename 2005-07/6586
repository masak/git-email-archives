Dear diary, on Sat, Jul 16, 2005 at 07:46:00PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...
> I do not know what release plan Linus has in mind, and also
> expect things to be quieter next week during OLS and kernel
> summit, but I think we are getting really really close.

> Here are the things I think we would want to see before we hit
> 1.0:

>  - Remaining feature enhancements and fixes.
>

I hope to get to it tomorrow but it now occurred to me that I don't know
when do you actually want to release 1.0 and I think it's crucial for it
to support some sensible HTTP transport - I saw some scripts going in
etc, but what's its current state? Is it usable?

Note that I really _loved_ the Daniel's tools while they lasted. What I
loved most about them was that they really only pulled objects I needed
and not a single worthless one. Does the current HTTP transport share
this property?

Note that I also want to setup a simple "proof-of-concept" GIT homepage
tomorrow. Well, write it, where it should be hosted can be worked out
later and I have places for it to reside at for now. (Suggestions for
final hosting welcome. In reality, how nice (and persistent) the URL
gets is probably the only thing that really matters. My attempt will
live at http://git.or.cz/.)
