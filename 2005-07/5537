It's a log.  It's a standard technique to append entries to a log.  The 
requirements for this to always be consistent is that a) it's possible 
to know when the entry/entries at the end are inconsistent and b) it's 
always possible to roll back the log to a consistent state.

This is normally done with commit records (write data - fdatasync - 
write commit record - fdatasync), but in the case of git, the commit 
record isn't required because each git record is self-validating.  This 
is an incredibly powerful property.

If the log is written in topological sort order, then even a truncated 
log file is a valid (subset) git object store.
