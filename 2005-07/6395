Dear diary, on Sun, Jul 24, 2005 at 07:50:18PM CEST, I got a letter
where Wolfgang Denk <wd@denx.de> told me that...

Implementation. Should be fixed now, after rewriting part of it. ;-)

Of course. By the corner case I meant "the external patch tool invoked
by cg-patch emits bogus error in case of patch containing only mode
changes and nothing else". I wasn't aware that the changes wouldn't
apply at all - actually, I was when I was writing the code, but
completely forgot about it later.

Thanks,
