No, this is a merge conflict failure, and you simply have conflicts in the
tree. git did everything right, it just couldn't do an automatic merge.

We don't have any nice graphical tools to show these to you like BitKeeper 
had, although it shouldn't be fundamentally hard.

What you need to do is basically edit all those five files, and look for 
the conflicts (they are just like normal CVS conflicts:

	<<<<<<<
		orig-branch
		conflict-contents
	=======
		pulled-branch
		conflict-contents
	>>>>>>>>

and then you edit them to your liking until you have no more conflicts, 
and then you have to commit your manual resolve with

	git commit --all

which will commit the merge _and_ your manual conflict resolution.

This is something where a nice wrapper layer could do a lot better. I know 
there are graphical three-way merge programs available.

But core git is no worse (and in fact a _lot_ better) than CVS in this 
regard, so I feel that the git merge, while obviously not perfect or even 
very smart, is "sufficient" for what git is (ie it's up to porcelain to do 
anything better).
