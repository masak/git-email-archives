Ok paged back in my state.  The practical problem is that rpmbuild try
to lookup the build dependencies which simply aren't present on debian.
Patch will be along shortly once I get the glitches fixed.

One last issue with building packages.  Some distros are still shipping
GNU interactive tools so git as a package name for the rpm is problematic.
At the very least it is extremely confusing that git-0.99 is a more
recent package that git-4.3.20.
