Umm. I just discovered a portion of mailing list I somehow completely
missed. :/ Sorry for the delayed replies.

Dear diary, on Wed, Jun 15, 2005 at 03:45:21AM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...

in the meantime, I actually implemented the -f option. Now I agree that
cg-rm'd files should indeed be restored only when -f is passed. Not a
big deal yet since we don't remove them at all now. :-)
