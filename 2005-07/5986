It does. It gets all the history necessary for each branch. git-rev-list
will walk the whole history until it hits commits that as been marked as
uninteresting (or the parents of commits that have been marked as
uninteresting), and those are the ones that the receiver already has, of
course.

So after you get a pack, you have all the history for all the branches you 
got.

A branch you _didn't_ get, you don't get any history for, of course, but 
that doesn't matter. You'll get that history if you ever pull the branch 
later.
