Dear diary, on Fri, Jul 22, 2005 at 11:26:29PM CEST, I got a letter
where "YOSHIFUJI Hideaki / ?$B5HF#1QL@" <yoshfuji@linux-ipv6.org> told me that...

I see, I didn't know about this. Well, I didn't actually use the #
stringificator many times. Perhaps a short comment would be due.

It uses only two words ("create socket") from that, though. ;-)

	if (connect() < 0) sockfd = -2;
	...
	if (sockfd == -1) die("unable to create socket");
	else die("unable to connect")

or I'd prefer the second error message "unable to connect", which is
perhaps more descriptive regarding what effectively happened.

BTW, could the close() on the socket ever fail (read as "modify errno")
here?
