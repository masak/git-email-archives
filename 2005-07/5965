Well, it means that the order you move them doesn't matter, because it
will ignore the pair if either hasn't been moved.

(Off topic: note that git-http-pull writes the _index_ first, because it
fetches it to determine if it should fetch the pack)

IIRC, we check the size of the pack file and there are hashes around the
ends of the two files which have to match; but this is a die() check, not
an ignore check, so we just crash with a clear error message rather than
doing crazy stuff (like reading from beyond the end of the mmap).

We should never write anything under the final name, anyway, for just this
reason; we already use open/write/close/rename for objects, refs, and
cache (maybe not working directory files, though). I think we're actually
agreeing on this.

My position is that the temporary location should be something like
{final-name}.part, such that it doesn't match *.idx or *.pack beforehand
(so it doesn't look like a complete file that you might want to send to
someone) and it doesn't have to worry about EXDEV on the rename. Also, I
would ideally like to be able to resume an interrupted download, which
means that it would have to find the partial file in a predictable
location, given what it's supposed to contain.
