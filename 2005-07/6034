I tried this last night with Ubuntu (Warty).  The openssl package
doesn't include header files so presumably you would need to install
openssl-dev, only that package doesn't seem to exist in Ubuntu-land.  I
gave up at this point and installed on a different system.

The README file for cogito/git mentions that there is an ssl library
included in the source which you can use if you don't have openssl.  It
doesn't give any directions on how to use it, however.  You could try
looking into using that.
