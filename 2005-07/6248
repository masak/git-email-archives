Dear diary, on Thu, Jul 14, 2005 at 05:26:07PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

Just a side note for casual readers, Cogito could use a cleanup here -
from large part it ignores things like git-checkout-cache -u simply
because there was no such option at the time that part of Cogito was
written. I myself am not even too familiar about those gazillions of
funny new options, and as long as it works, I prefer not to touch that
code, but if someone is bored and wants to get familiar with core git
usage as well as Cogito internals...
