I was confused.  My big problem was that we don't really have
an in tree user, and there wasn't a good explanation anywhere.  So it
was hard to track this down. 

I'm going to lobby for a script to import patches from email being
in the git tree just so people can see how this is done, and probably
because there are a lot of people who have been reinventing this
script :)
