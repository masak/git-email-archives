Daniel, I would really have liked to merge this immediately, but
somehow the patch is whitespace damaged.  Depressingly enough,
almost all patches I got from various people today had different
whitespace damages, and I started to suspect if there is
something wrong on my end, but it does not appear to be the
case.  The copies found in the usual archive I check show the
same problems as the copies I got directly in my mailbox have.

Could you resend these two if it is not too much trouble for
you?  

Thanks for fixing the curl_easy_setopt() screwup.  I should have
been more careful.  I've already hand-merged it and will be
pushing it out shortly, so there is no need to resend that one.
