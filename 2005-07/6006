Dear diary, on Tue, Jul 12, 2005 at 06:34:33AM CEST, I got a letter

Could we please have the branch name written to .git/head-name in case
we switch the branch? The reason is that .git/HEAD may not be always a
symlink. Specifically, I do this - there's a command cg-seek, which will
seek your working tree to a given commit, while staying on the branch
(committing and some other operations are blocked). In that case, I
remove .git/HEAD and replace it with ID of the commit I'm seeked at, and
when I'm "unseeking" back to the top, I replace it with the symlink
again. With some heuristics, I could create .git/head-name at the time
of seek and hope, but I think it'd be cleaner to just always set it
(except when we are on the master branch), if you agree.

Note that even though Cogito won't let you create/change a local branch
yet, it will understand .git/head-name and hopefully behave properly
(although it's totally untested, of course).
