OK, that is your opinion and your work flow. But porcelains perhaps would like 
to allow other work flows, even if it seems confusing for you.

And I think the problem here simple is that send-pack *forces* local and 
remote head names to be the same. This is forcing policy to porcelains, but 
GIT should be only about plumbing.

Perhaps the solution is to allow more flexibility in GIT.
What about introducing an additional environment GIT_REFS_DIR?
When using send-pack, the porcelain would set this variable to a directory 
containing a 1:1 name relationship to the remote repository.
