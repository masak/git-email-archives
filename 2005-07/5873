Dear diary, on Sat, Jul 09, 2005 at 11:04:37PM CEST, I got a letter
where Matthias Urlichs <smurf@smurf.noris.de> told me that...

Or you can do cg-patch, which should handle that for you properly as
well.  I think the "no fuzz" approach is hyper-paranoid. I deal with
small or larger fuzz all the time when I'm reordering patches or
applying them to a few hours younger version than they were based on. I
think the restriction it imposes is overly draconian here and doesn't
trust the developer to know what he is doing as much as it should. (And
that's why cg-patch doesn't use git-apply. ;-)
