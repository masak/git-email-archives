Yeah, but I would argue that is the right thing to do.

Symlink'd trees don't really make sense to me (they seem fragile and
somewhat pointless) but perhaps I'm missing something?

I don't see how that's helpful.  The idea of echo_to_file is to make
the metadata self-contained to the subtree --- so we don't want to
have external links (possibly) pointing outside of it.
