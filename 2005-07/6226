Yes. But it have not integration with user environment. Personally I use 
koi8-r environment and doing "cg commit" (and probably "git commit" too) 
results in koi8-r text written as commit text. I remember that this issue 
were discussed on this list and all come to conclusion that utf-8 is the only 
sane encoding that can be used in this case.
But this should not be user's problem - it's just the UI that doesn't 
understands when transcoding should be done.
Similarly - when I start gitk then I see only weird symbols instead of commit 
text, not matter what encoding I use for commits - koi8-r or utf-8. BTW 
russian koi8-r encoded text _in_diff_contents_ show correctly. Wonder why...
