Ok, done.

I made git-diff-cache _and_ git-diff-files limit the pathnames early, so
that they don't even bother expanding the tree objects that are
irrelevant, and don't bother even validating index objects that don't
match the pathnames given.

Junio - I think this makes gitcore-pathspec pretty pointless, but I didn't
actually remove it. I guess "git-diff-helper" still uses it.
