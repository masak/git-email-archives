Dear diary, on Sat, Jun 11, 2005 at 03:32:30AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Any reason why this was not applied? It appears kind of cool. Well, I
will probably take it and extend cg-mkpatch with it so I don't need it
in Git, but I'm so altruistic and want to bring at least a bit of light
to the gloomy dark world of the poor core Git plumbing users.  ;-)
