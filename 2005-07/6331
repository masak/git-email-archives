Dear diary, on Sat, Jul 23, 2005 at 01:50:09AM CEST, I got a letter

No, no, no. A user does not alter the settings locally in .gitinfo/ -
.gitinfo/ is for per-_project_ stuff, not per-user. If user wants an
override, he does it per-repository in his .git/conf directory, which is
not version-tracked (actually, core GIT does not even let me to).

Actually, commit-ignore might be useful in other cases, e.g. when
someone (me, a thousand times in the past) needs to keep temporary hacks
in the Makefile so that he can actually build the thing on his weird
system etc. ;-)
