While we are talking about changing tag object format/fields,
I've wondered if we would want to be able to associate more than
one objects with a single tag (i.e. have more than one "object"
lines just like commits can have more than one "parent" lines).
I admit that it would not be a "tag" anymore, rather, it would
be a "bag".

I wanted to have something like this in the past for some reason
I do not exactly remember anymore, but basically it was to
record "here is the list of related objects."

I could fake it with a multi-parent commit with a commit message
if all I want to include are commits with a single blob, but
that is (1) abusing the commit to record something that is not
even a merge, and (2) the tree associated with that commit would
not mean anything.
