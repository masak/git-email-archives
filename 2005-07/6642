And yes, I did generate this thread with this script - so I have proof
that it works nicely.

Actually, with this:
	git format-patch -n --mbox -o ../pending/ origin
	git send-email ../pending/
	<answer some questions>

In 2-3 minutes I should have my git tree at
rsync://h4x0r5.com/git-ryan.git/ updated with these changes, and my
SYNOPSIS draft.  (I haven't added the short tutorial that Sam suggested
yet, that's a task for another 4am hackfest.)
