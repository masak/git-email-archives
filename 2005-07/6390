Dear diary, on Tue, Jul 12, 2005 at 11:07:43AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

The thing is, _everything_ assumes .git/HEAD is the current commit
checked out in the index. All the Cogito (that wouldn't be hard to
change at all), all the other Porcelains, the core GIT tools. So
changing that would be difficult and it's much easier this way.

After some thought, I like Linus' approach more now, having head-name
only when it's really necessary.
