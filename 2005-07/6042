That conflicts with my usage, where I have a single repository for all of
my working directories, with .git/refs and .git/objects being symlinks to 
it, but .git/HEAD being different for each branch. The stuff in objects/
and refs/ really shouldn't depend on what you're currently doing for this
reason.

My way of thinking of "master" is that it's a real branch, which is for
all of the situations where you aren't using a specially-designated
branch. For many people, they only do stuff that's not designated
specially; Jeff only does stuff that is designated specially. But if you
do both, you'll want master to be left alone while you work on the side
branch.
