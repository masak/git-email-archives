cg-Xnormid is terminally broken in the presence of packed files, since 
it cannot look into them to find objects.  Moreover, many uses of 
commit-id in the scripts can be eliminated because the underlying git 
commands can already understand tags directly, and will check for 
invalid ids then.  The only thing missing is the short id matching.

Yes you can still pass in the tree id.
