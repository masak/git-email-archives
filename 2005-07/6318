Don't you think that would be a per-project decision?  Is it
acceptable if I make sure that .gitinfo/* is _optional_ and
things do not break for projects that do not use it?

I hope you are not vetoing the ongoing discussion in another
thread from including the per-project configuration.

Some people want to run their project differently, and one thing
I see often done is to have pre-commit hooks that always run
test suites [*1*].  I do not think it is an unreasonable thing for
Porcelains to support, and what I am trying to get at is if two
Porcelains decide to support it, they do it in a compatible way.

I agree.  The .gitinfo/fake-parents may be a good thing in that
sense to have project-wide, and as long as the kernel person
(that is you) do not add .gitinfo/commit-template you would be
happy, wouldn't you?


[Footnote]

*1* Personally sometimes I feel myself that is silly, but that
is _other_ people's project, not my own.  I think letting them
follow their own workflow to slow themselves is better than
outright forbidding it and telling them not to do it.
