Dear diary, on Mon, Jul 04, 2005 at 12:40:52AM CEST, I got a letter

Actually, the minimum is 4 characters, but that shouldn't be much of an
issue. Cogito's behaviour is to raise an error in case of multiple
matches; but that could be controlled by a switch too...

	bash$ complete -C git-rev-parse git* cg*


I will cook up a patch in a day or two if noone outruns me.
