  Hi,

  those two bits were long kept local to git-pb. You can either apply
the patches or pull:

	www.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/git-pb.git

The bits are mostly cosmetic but I want to get rid of them. :-)

  I'd like to know what to do with the git-pb branch in the future.
Based on what do you think, I can either:

  (i) Keep the git-pb branch polished and nice-to-merge, if you want to
pull from it.

  (ii) Keep the git-pb branch polished and nice-to-merge and rebase it
regularily if you don't want loong edges in your history graph, but
want to pull from it.

  (ii) Do wild things in the git-pb branch and send you patches.
