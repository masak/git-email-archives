  Hello,

  after skimming through it, I think I completely like what you have
shown here. I'm only concerned about this:

Dear diary, on Mon, Jul 25, 2005 at 12:49:33AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...
>     $ cat Documentation/.gitignore
>     # ignore generated html files,
>     # except foo.html which is maintained by hand
>     !foo.html
>     *.html

  I think this is wrong, and my brief experiments confirm that. I think
that the actually useful semantics of exclusion would be for
_subsequent_ exclusions, not preliminary ones. You generally don't say
"I never want this ignored, but I want the rest of that ignored", but
"I want that ignored, except this". This also gives you more
flexibility:

	*.html
	!f*.html
	fo*.html

would ignore *.html and fo*.html, but not any other f*.html filenames.
But more importantly,

	.gitignore: *.txt
	Documentation/.gitignore: !*.txt

will not work, which was the whole _point_ of the exclusion.

Could we please have this semantics changed for those reasons?

Thanks,
