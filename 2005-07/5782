In addition to GNU arch/tla, it it also supported by baz, ArX, darcs, 
and mercurial.

Absolutely. For the kernel it might not make sense, but I view it as a 
really important feature for tiny projects around the world. Even a CGI 
requirement makes it impossible to serve a project from free or really 
cheap web hosts. Plain HTTP is the only protocol available to people who 
have no extra money to spend on hosting accounts.

This happens to be a hot button issue for me, in case you can't tell. 
Sorry if I'm ranting.
