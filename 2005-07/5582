OK, I see. How about using wiggle instead?

        http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/wiggle/

That's what patch-utils uses if you run "pushpatch -m". wiggle is also
a lot smarter than diff3, so there will be fewer cases that result in
a conflict. Maybe a parameter to "stg push" could enable wiggle mode.

Another nice thing from patch-utils is that if applying the patch
would have failed, nothing will be done by "pushpatch". You then have
the option to rerun it with -m (merge) or -f (force, create .rej
files), or decide that you don't want to push the patch at all. The
last part is quite useful if you try to reorder a patch series, find
out that you would get a thousand conflicts, and want to reconsider.

Is there a way in StGIT to undo a push that results in a large mess of
conflicts?

That's a useful feature. With patch-utils, I used to drop patches
manually, but that could lose information if the patch applied
upstream is not exactly the same as the one I had locally.
