Since Linus and Junio were unhappy with my previous set of patches to
make git and cogito compatible with OS X and other BSD unices, I have
redone my patches to cogito along a similar line.

There is still one outstanding incompatibility:  cogito makes use of
cp -u.  I have this message from Junio:

> I do not speak for Pasky, but to me "cp -u" sounds just like an
> optimization, so maybe defining CP_U='cp -u' and detect missing

Pasky, does this seem reasonable?  Is there a better way?  So far I
have been able to avoid adding the "config.sh" contained in my first
script.

cheers,
Bryan
