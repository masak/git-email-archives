cg-update origin
and then I edited drivers/serial/8250.c

As discovered using:

	sh -x /usr/bin/cg-diff drivers/serial/8250.c

it appears that cg-diff does a

	git-update-cache --refresh >/dev/null

each time it's run, which is taking the bulk of the time.  Also note
that curiously, it exits with status 1.
