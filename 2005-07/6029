Hmm, in an ideal world all of those stipulations are right around the
corner.  Also, if the split is done, then cogito can depend on a specific
version of git-core, to help isolate against those upstream changes.
The main thing then is getting any local changes you have pushed to
Linus' git tree (if there are still any).

Adding Provides is probably only useful if there's some other package
that's relying on git being there (i.e. gitweb perhaps).  I guess we
can add that, and remove it when there's proper dependencies in order.
May as well do git-core as is now done in git.

thanks,

Mark cogito rpm package as providing git-core, since it currently does.
