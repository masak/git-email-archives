What's the format of the short ID? Minimum 6 characters of the SHA1 or
something?

Pack-files in many ways should be even easier to look up the ID in, since
the pack-file index has all the SHA1's for that pack file listed in sorted
order, so it should be fairly easy to just look it up based on the first
few bytes.. If somebody sends me a patch, that should be fine.

That is indeed something that seems to make more sense in cg-Xnormid.
