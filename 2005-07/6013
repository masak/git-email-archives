It is written in the TODO file but didn't have time to do it. I'm
working on moving all the commands from main.py into separate files
under stgit/commands/ for a clearer view. This should be ready in the
next day or two and, after that, I will work on other commands.

I thought about integrating sendpatchset into stgit but it is much
simpler to just generate a control file (especially if you want to
review what you're going to send). Is the subject line always the
first line of the patch description?
