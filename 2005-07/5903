Well, the main difference is that pack-files can be used for many things.

For example, a web interface for getting a pack-file between two releases: 
say you knew you had version xyzzy, and you want to get version xyzzy+1, 
you could do that through webgit some way even with a "stupid" interface. 
Kay already had some patch to generate pack-files for something.

The point being that pack-files are _not_ like objects. Pack-files are 
meant for communication. Having them in .git/objects/pack is just one 
special case.

We could sha1-sum the "sorted by SHA1" list, I guess.
