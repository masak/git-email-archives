No, I mean git-diff-cache.  I find that this works pretty well, though.

  # git-update-cache `git-diff-cache | cut -f2`

It looks like the same thing works for git-diff-files. 

  # git-update-cache `git-diff-files | cut -f2`

This seems to agree with the way you handle things.

Similarly, there is the need to determine which files are new to the
tree.  This isn't much of a burden when creating files in the tree,
but can be bothersome when using patch since git-apply is conservative
about fuzz.
