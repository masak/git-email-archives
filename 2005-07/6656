This series adds support for downloading pack files when appropriate in 
http-pull. When it finds that a needed object is not available, it 
downloads info/packs (into memory), identifies any pack files it doesn't 
have from there, downloads indices of any of these that it doesn't have, 
and downloads the pack containing the object. If other packs are also 
needed, it downloads them when it reaches them.
