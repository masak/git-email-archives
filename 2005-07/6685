More bugging...

- Either stay with your idea of "Git is the idea, git the implementation"
  (iff blessed by the Git Powers That Be) and be consistent about it, or
  just use "git" throughout.

- Attribute the meaning appropiately, say by:

At least cogito includes a (slightly old) version of git. Dunno about
StGIT. And git and cogito have a gitk inside too. This should be mentioned,
i.e., look at the package(s) you are interested and see what else they
carry or require and keep in mind that (for now?) getting git as part of
one package is /not/ guaranteed to be compatible with another or standard
git.
