Dear diary, on Sat, Jul 23, 2005 at 01:26:07AM CEST, I got a letter

Some example of possible per-project settings:

	pre-commit hook killing trailing whitespaces
	global per-project ignore file (*.ko or something)
	common base commit template
		(standardized form developer fills in when committing,
		 some remindments in the comment section, ...)

Obviously, you still ought to have a way to locally override any of
those per-repository in your .git/conf/.
