Are really necessary to have both --exclude-from=<file> and 
--exclude-per-directory=<name> ?

Peraphs, if the file name of excluded list is the same for each directory, 
e.g. .gitignore or something similar, instead of --exclude-per-directory
we can use a concept of file validity 'scope' and just use --exclude-from=<file>.
If entering in a directory <file> is found its contents are appended and 
removed when leaving directory. A bad analogy can be with the use of 
recursive Makefile.

If we use the 'scope' logic we can just prepend path when adding entries
and serach with with FNM_PATHNAME flag.

Same comment as above, if prepending path when adding per 
directory contents we can simplify to always use FNM_PATHNAME flag.

We don't have even to special case base directory global
scope <file> if we use realtive paths so that we prepend its contents 
with ./ and we have what we expect.

I am sorry to not be able to send a patch, better explaining what 
proposed but I am just leaving today and I will be off line
for a couple of weeks.
