Dear diary, on Fri, Jul 22, 2005 at 11:16:51PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Good idea. More interesting exercise would be to make a script which
extracts the values back after the user had a chance to touch it.

Cogito shows '[NMD] filename' in place of @FILELIST@.

This brings me to another subject, M and N are pretty hard to
distinguish visually without close inspection of the output. What about
switching to use A instead of N everywhere?
