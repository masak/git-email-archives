Dear diary, on Tue, Jul 05, 2005 at 07:46:12AM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...
> Hello!

Hello,

> It would be useful to have a script to display current status of the

> just want to offer this scripts as a base for further work.

> Signed-off-by: Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>

thanks. I've somewhat cleaned it up and added some more information to
show, and committed it.
