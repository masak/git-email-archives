I like the general idea.  But I hate the code implications for
echoing environmental variables that git cares about.  Especially
since we really don't care about the environmental variables.  Instead
we are doing this because we are doing things that the are best
not done in shell.

So I have made the program git-var [ -l | <variable name ]

Without the implicit tying we can just export those values
that we find interesting. -l will list all of the variables
and their values like env, while specifying an single variable
will just read that variables value.
