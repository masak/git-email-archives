Yep.  I confused the want and have cases when I was reading
the code. 

A generalization of git-fetch-pack that can handle multiple
heads looks like it would handle the transfer part of the
problem with tags.  git-clone-pack already does.  Then
all that is needed is a sane way to list the heads that
are read back and some post processing to install everything.

The big question is in what format should we return the heads?
Just a space separated list of sha1's or a directory hierarchy
like git-clone-pack uses.

Eric
