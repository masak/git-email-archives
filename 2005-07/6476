Dear diary, on Thu, Jul 28, 2005 at 01:08:03AM CEST, I got a letter
where Brian O'Mahoney <omb@khandalf.com> told me that...

I think there are basically none dependencies like this, or if they are
any, they virtually never break under regular usage. At least I never do
make clean and I never saw a rebuild of git to break.

I think especially for smaller projects recursive make is just fine and
makes maintenance easier, and I think most of the arguments about the
dependency graph rarely matter in real projects (especially ones of the
size of git). So I'd say, keep it as it is till we can. :-)

For what layers?
