They work pretty well, the core git commands have no problem with them
and I just sent off some patches for gitweb and gitk.

All git/objects directories can be merged into a common repository. The
refs/heads and refs/tags be copied to user specific subdirectories.

Then a pull like,
    git pull http://www.kernel.org/.../torvalds/linux-2.6.git

Would become,
    git pull http://www.kernel.org/.../linux-2.6.git torvalds/linux-2.6/master

It would make rsync more expensive for people who are interested in only
a branch or two, but there is only one repository which should be easier
on the mirrors. The http, ssh, and some future 'pack' transfer methods
won't see a difference since they only pull the specific commits they
need to catch up with a branch.
