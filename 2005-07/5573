Hi Peter,

Thanks for trying this tool.

I know that using -A gives a more detailed output in case of a conflict.
The problem is that you will get a conflict even if the changes are
identical, making it impossible to detect when a patch was merged
upstream.

For example:

ancestor:	aaa
branch1:	aaa
		bbb
branch2:	aaa
		bbb

diff3 -E:	aaa
		bbb
diff3 -A:	aaa
		<<<<<<< ancestor
		=======
		bbb
		>>>>>>> branch2

In version 0.3, in case of a conflict, StGIT leaves 3 files in the tree:
file.older, file.local and file.remote so that one can use a graphical
tool to do the merge. I think these names are a bit misleading, .remote
extension means the file in the patch and .local is the one in the tree
before pushing the patch. Anyway, it might be invoking a graphical tool
directly from gitmergeonefile.py.

Speaking of detecting upstream merges, the latest StGIT snapshot shows a
'0' in front of a patch if it is empty, when 'stg series' is invoked.
When pushing, if all the changes are the same, it notifies you that the
patch is empty so that it can be safely removed.
