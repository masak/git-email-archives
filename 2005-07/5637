Hello!

It would be useful to have a script to display current status of the
repository - branches, current branch and merge status.  Maybe I'm
missing something, but I don't see such script.

I wrote a script that would do that.  I'm still not fully familiar with
the concepts of cogito, so maybe wrong terms are used in the script.  I
just want to offer this scripts as a base for further work.

cg-info sounds very pretentious, so maybe the script should be renamed
to cg-heads-ls or cg-admin-status or something like that.
