  Hi,

  just a heads-up, I deprecated the rsync access method in the latest
Cogito. For all kernel.org trees, just using HTTP instead should do,
and most of the other GIT repository URLs I noticed use HTTP as well.
rsync is evil and with packs likely doubly so for general GIT access.

  I will probably remove rsync access support altogether after another
one or two Cogito releases to give this some transition time; in the
meantime, cg-pull (cg-update, subsequently) will shout a warning.

  The only big advantage of rsync is that it is probably (I didn't
measure it, but it feels so) faster especially for smaller repositories,
larger updates and higher latency links. Hopefully we (I hope Daniel
gets to it, but I will do it in foreseeable future if he doesn't)
improve this too.

  Does anyone have anything on mind what rsync can do and the git-*-pull
tools can't (or can but a lot worse)?

  Have a nice localtime.timeofday,
