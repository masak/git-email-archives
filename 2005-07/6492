Dear diary, on Mon, Jul 25, 2005 at 10:27:36PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

They should. If you don't want them take effect in most of the
directories, you would add them as ./pattern in the parent directory,
while if you want them to take effect in most of the directories, you
would exclude them in the ones you don't want the pattern to take effect
in (if you accept my proposal for ! semantics change).

Yes, that's what I meant.
