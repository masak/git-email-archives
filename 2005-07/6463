Thanks for the references.

A quick read of the paper and some of the rebuttals make me think that 
either way (recursive/non-recursive):
	* require about the same amount of makefile/dependency maintenance work 
from developers.
	* allow developers to be lazy in different ways with 
makefiles/dependencies.
	* achieves the same end.

The non-recursive make method may have a small advantage for developers 
using Git for their SCM because the Git operations are also performed at 
the top level due to Git's design.
