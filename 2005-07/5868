That seems to work, thanks.  I think this is a good idea anyway -
it seems to mean that each working tree ends up with an empty set of
.git/objects/* directories.  When new work is done in a tree, the
corresponding objects then appear, and only these objects need
transferring upstream.

It means that rsync --delete-after can (in theory) be used when
making changes available to the upstream maintainer.
