How? Only when you explicitly specify the remote head. When you're
explicit, you ought to know what are you doing.

AFAIK the plan is to centralize all the kernel repositories to a single
one. For that, developers would generally push into branches with name
different that "master".

If you fear making mistakes, better use something which attempts to do
some babysitting for you, like Cogito. ;-)
