In the today's snapshot you can get the 'stg push --undo' command which
reverts the result of a push operation (either failed or not). The patch
is reverted to its previous state. It works even if you ran 'refresh'.

The current implementation does not remove the .older/.local/.remote
files from the tree when undoing a push. I think I will first implement
a 'resolve' command which takes care of these files.

Anyway, once I fully test the current state of stgit, I will make the
0.4 release (probably this weekend).
