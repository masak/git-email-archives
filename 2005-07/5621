I'm making something based on pack-files.

git-local-pull is indeed walking the whole tree and copying one file at a
time. We shouldn't use "git-fetch-script" in "git clone" (it's really
designed for doing one file at a time and for small updates),

That said, the pack-file thing I'm working on won't be perfect either, and
the main advantage is that it should work over ssh. The fastest way to do
a clone is really to do a recursive hardlinked tree, so you may well want
to just do

	#!/bin/sh
	mkdir "$2" && cp -rl "$1/.git" "$2/.git"

and it should be about a million times faster and equally effective.

Untested, of course.
