Petr,
	Commit 7c5977297f07c2a52c8c0f486309076b2a795d33 contains the
chunk:

-uri=$1
+
+infoonly=
+while optparse; do
+	if optparse -N; then
+		infoonly=-N
+	else
+		optfail
+	fi
+done
+
+uri=$ARGV

	However, $ARGV is not a variable I've ever seen supported in a
Bourne-like shell.  Certainly Bash supports BASH_ARGV, but not ARGV.
	The recent option parsing code adds ARGS in cg-Xlib, but not
ARGV.
	The upshot is that a cg-clone/cg-init attempt thinks $uri is
empty, and always creates an initial commit.  No clone.  I don't know
how folks have gotten cg-clone rsync://linus to work since this change
went in.
	I don't know what the proper solution is with the modern option
code, but changing it back to 'url=$1' allows me to grab Linus' tree.
