Yup, I do. I have this thing that I don't do backups, but I end up having 
redundancy instead, so I keep archives on my own machines and inside the 
private osdl network, for example.

Also, I suspect that anybody who uses the "CVS model" with git - ie a
central repository - is not likely to export that central repository any
way: it's the crown jewels, after all. Open source may not have that
mindset, but I'm thinking of how I was forced to use CVS at Transmeta, for
example:  the machine that had the CVS repo was certainly supposed to be
very private indeed.

In the "central repo model" you have another issue - you have potentially
parallell pushes to different branches with no locking what-so-ever (and
that's definitely _supposed_ to work), and I have this suspicion that the 
"update for dumb servers" code isn't really safe in that setting anyway. I 
haven't checked.
