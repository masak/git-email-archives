I uploaded a new snapshot (stgit-20050704.tar.gz) which has support for
merge tool configuration. It installs a default /etc/stgitrc file but
you can define your own options in ~/.stgitrc or .git/stgitrc (the
latter overrides the options in the earlier files). You can even define
something like - 'diff3 ... || xxdiff ...' so that if one tool fails it
will try the next one (the whole command is executed with 'sh -c').

I will try to write an 'undo' command in the next days.
