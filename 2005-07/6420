I imagined it, but it appears to me that this is a bad example.
My understanding of what Catalin and the proposed patch
disagrees is whether the patterns in .gitignore at the top level
should govern files under ppc/ and mozilla-sha1/ subdirectories;
Catalin thinks they should not.

What I meant by "cumulative" (now I realize I might have
misunderstood what Pasky wanted to mean by that word, though)
was not just .gitignore in subdirectory being added, but the
effect of patterns being added so far, either from the command
line or by parent directories, last while in the deeper
directories.
