I've been missing for a couple of weeks due to my server dying and needing 
to be replaced; I think stuff is mostly back in order now. (But I'm not 
yet resubscribed, and I suspect only dumb mailers are currently willing 
to talk to my mail server, for some reason I don't yet understand; I'm 
sort of reading the archives, at least.)

I still have the patch to make git-http-pull download packs, and I should 
be able to get it to read the objects/info/packs file without too much 
trouble.

I was also in progress on a series to rearrange the code in pull.c such 
that it passes the objects it needs through a list such that it can 
request them in parallel. I'd gotten as far as making it blast out 
requests for objects over git-ssh-pull (and then break because it doesn't 
expect to be able to accidentally read part of the next object while 
reading the current object); it shouldn't be too hard to make the HTTP 
version use this to parallelize requests as well.

I expect I'll get to work on this on Sunday, in any case.
