A couple of pieces.  The dist target has assumes git-tar-tree is in the
path.  Making it so you have to have git installed to build the rpm.

The man pages are not built. The build dependencies do not call out
the tools necessary to build the man pages.

And it does not pass my torture test of building rpm's on debian,
but that is not a huge problem.

Are you still up for a patch that records who and when made a tag?
I sent one but it seems to have been lost.
