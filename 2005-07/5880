Hm. Dunno why that happened -- it's readable now, and also at
http://david.woodhou.se/cg-feedmaillist.sh

It's done locally on hera though -- so the mirroring shouldn't be a
problem. IIRC the reason it uses rsync is because I wasn't getting tags
when it was using whatever other method was the default for a local
'parent repository'.

That was actually more relevant for the snapshots than the mailing list
feed, though -- so even if it isn't fixed now, I could live without
tags.

More usefully though, if ordering really isn't a problem on your
repository then I should probably rewrite the script to work directly
from that instead of from a copy.
