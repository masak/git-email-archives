  Hello,

  here is Cogito 0.12.1, another desperate attempt to keep pace with
'@' or Linus, the named Human Master Coder. (Linus, the Human Master
Coder, mumbles arcane do { formulae } while (0)!  Some kind of force
seems to attack your mind.  Everything suddenly looks so different...
You are confused.)  Visit the greater spellbook vault at

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito

or re-attune yourself to the git plane (in case you are already
connected to the mana flow of Cogito) for updated powerful
counter-magick.

  Most of it is upstream stuff. Otherwise, almost everything are
bugfixes and updates to deal better with the mighty pack stuff.
Important bugfixes is fixed parent-id (cg-admin-uncommit, subsequently)
and massive pull fixes w.r.t. pulling from packed repositories and
cross-filesystem local pull.

  Oh, don't get used too much to the new cg-info script's semantics,
I want to move the functionality to cg-status; I just forgot to do it
before tagging the release and only remembered it now.

  May the sun always shine on you,
