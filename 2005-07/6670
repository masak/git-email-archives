There is no lock that works reliably except for the "create a directory 
and rename it onto another directory"

Please do it in the hook layer.

Hmm.. I suspect it's partly just because there is existing code that does
the fork()/exec() thing because it needs to do IO, and system() doesn't
close the right pipes after fork etc.

"system()" really is very inflexible. It basically never works if you have 
any shared file descriptors.
