Dear diary, on Wed, Jul 06, 2005 at 02:01:38PM CEST, I got a letter
where Brian Gerst <bgerst@didntduck.org> told me that...

It won't happen. Or rather, I hope the HTTP pulls become more efficient
soon. Actually, perhaps Linus has something done already, my workstation
is a bit derailed now so I couldn't pull from him in the last few days
(hopefully will sort that out today).

Hmm, yes, I guess Linus won't be touching the HTTP backend at all. ;-) I
suggest you to check the last development in Linus' branch and sync with
Daniel Barkalow, who promised improving the pull tools as well.
