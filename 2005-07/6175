For this we need a cgi script that will generate an appropriate
pack.  Although stupid http fetching may have some potential
if we ditch libcurl and use pipelining for http 1.1.  Bandwidth
wise that will never equal a custom pack because it will not do
deltas.  But in the common case of an incremental pull it should
be able to equal rsync.

Do we want to put some porcelain around, git-fsck-cache --tags?
So we can discover the tag objects in the archive and place
them someplace usable.  Jeff Garzik in his howto is still recommending:

>   .git/

Which feels like something is missing.  Given that tags are
sha1-indexed objects we should be pulling them.  And I believe you can
have a tag as a parent of a commit, so even with the pack optimized
clients we should be pulling them now.
