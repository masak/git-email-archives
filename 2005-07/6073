No, the point being that he (or anybody else) could move the commits as
patches, one by one, from his 2.6.11 base to whatever later base that _is_
in the commit history.

It's really the same issue as with cherry-picking: you do commits one at a
time as diffs, see if that diff already exists in the destination stream,
and if not, you try to apply it as a patch and re-commit it with the old
commit message in a new place in history.
