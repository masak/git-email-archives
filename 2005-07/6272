This patch includes two fixes to the git-core Debian package:

    * Conflict with the GNU Interactive Tools package, which _also_
      wants to install /usr/bin/git.

    * Compile against the unencumbered Mozilla SHA1 code, instead of
      the iffy OpenSSL code.  This makes it easier to get the package
      included for distribution with Debian.

Note: Assumes that Ryan Anderson's patch "Deb packages should include
the binaries" has been applied.
