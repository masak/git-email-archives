Dear diary, on Sat, Jul 09, 2005 at 04:20:13PM CEST, I got a letter
where Thomas Lord <lord@emf.net> told me that...

..snip..

But object retrieval can be potentially as much as linear to the depth
of the prereq graph, right? I don't think any of the benefits you listed
are worth the complication, and you can still do the reachability
analysis pretty easily. (And I think it takes the same number of
roundtrips when downloading from remote server?)

In git, this is crucial at least for distinguishing commits and tags.
I personally consider the verifiability boost useful.

I think they are only word-size specific, and that should be no big
matter to resolve, shall anyone want to.

All right, the portability could be better. ;-)

Kind regards,
