Actually, never mind. zlib does exactly the right thing, and eats the 8 
bytes of header that it wrote for "empty". The real culprit was that 
git-unpack-objects incorrectly made that zero a special case on reading, 
but not writing.

So just ignore me. zlib actually does what I expected it to do, even for 
the zero case.
