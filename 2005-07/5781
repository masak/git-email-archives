Hmm.. The more I think about it, the less I think this is about "full 
objects".

After all, we won't have all objects: the pack will still cut off any 
commits that may be reachable but not interesting.

So this is more specifically about full _trees_, not objects per se. So 
while the name of the option doesn't really matter all that much, I do 
think it would make more sense as "--whole-trees" or something like that.

However, I really don't think it's a very useful option in the first
place. Any dumb web-based thing that depends on "--whole-trees" would suck
horribly. For the kernel, it means that you'd be guaranteed 17,000+ files,
and there would be very few deltas in there, so you'd have this 40MB+
pack-file. Which is _not_ an acceptable way of getting updates.
