Yes, it is my understanding that "clone" means to literally
clone, not "pull into an empty repository with renamed head
names", to the core GIT.  I do not speak for Pasky, but Cogito's
"clone" seems to have a bit different semantics (which I suspect
is more friendly to the users in many situations).

Similarly, "push" to the core GIT (that is what git-send-pack is
about) means performing a subset of "clone" in reverse.  This is
primarily to synchronise two repositories owned by a single
person.
