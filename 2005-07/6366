That's not actually what "distributed" means. There are several 
distributed SCM tools[1] that store repo information outside the actual 
working directory.

Perhaps that last sentence could be something like "This means that each 
developer has a local full-fledged repository with full revision 
tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access to a central 
server." I'm sure there are better wordings, but I hate to point out an 
problem without offering at least one possible improvement.

[1] I believe that ArX, monotone, codeville, and svk all fall into this 
category. Possibly even Arch itself, although I haven't researched that.
