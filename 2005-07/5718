No, that doesn't work at all.

"sq_expand()" tries to protect things inside single quotes. That's a 
totally different problem (and btw, it does so badly: it doesn't quote '\' 
for example).

For a shell command line, there are _tons_ of special characters that you
mustn't pass through. Things like ';', '<', '>', '&' all have magic
meaning and are not valid in the destination name. Not to mention just
simple whitespace.
