Dear diary, on Sat, Jul 09, 2005 at 12:34:44AM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...
> Hello, Petr!

Hello,

> Please consider this script for Cogito.
> 
> Signed-off-by: Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>

the script is definitively interesting, but I have couple of notes
about it first:

(i) -i sounds wrong for anything but being interactive here ;-) What
about -A?

(ii) I'm confused - if -a is all of the above, how do I clean _only_
regular files, and only those not ignored by cg-status?

(iii) Makes it any sense to remove only special files?

(iv) -r implies being recursive, but it has nothing to do with that
here.

(v) Semantically, I think it's quite close to cg-reset. What about
making it part of cg-reset instead of a separate command? I tend to be
careful about command inflation. (That's part of being careful about the
usability in general.) That's just an idea and possibly a bad one, what
do you think?

Thanks,
