Dear diary, on Sun, Jul 03, 2005 at 07:59:42AM CEST, I got a letter
where Brian Gerst <bgerst@didntduck.org> told me that...

But git-rev-parse sucks. It won't detect invalid IDs (--revs-only?), and
does not support short object IDs (that's a must, it's tremendously
useful). You need to add that for it to be useful first.

This is broken too. You need to be able to pass _tree_ ID to tree-id too,
not just commit ID. Hmm, or is git-rev-parse able to process any ids?
Then it's terribly misnamed too. :-) A comment would be useful in that
case. (Or better a patch to rename it.)

Thanks,
