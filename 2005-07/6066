This is really complicated, for no good reason.

The _object_ directories should be linked, but it's really wrong to link 
the "refs/" directories and expect them to have COW behaviour.

I've tried to make most of the git tools write the refs objects "safely" 
too, ie things like "git-receive-pack" (the receiving end of a 
"git-send-pack") will write the new ref to a lock-file and then do a 
"rename()" to set it. That is COW-safe, but the thing is, it's incredibly 
painful for many other operations, and I won't guarantee that git in 
general is always going to be COW-safe wrt all the git files.

For example, the "git clone -l" behaviour will _only_ link the objects 
subdirectory. The rest is copied. Unless there's a bug there somewhere.
