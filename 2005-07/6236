Noted, thanks for the info.

(This makes a lot of sense, Git is evolving very fast.  I haven't
looked at Git since mid-April, and I'm very much impressed at the
difference between 0.6 and 0.99.)

This is, of course, only possible when there are stable interfaces,
which in turn make change problematic.  (Which, as far as I
understand, is the very reason why the Linux kernel tree contains
everyone's and his brother's driver rather than having a stable module
ABI, but that's besides the point.)

Hold on...  Nobody is speaking about *binary* compatibility, it's
source-level compatibility that we need.  There is absolutely no
reason to introduce the complexities of shared libraries into the
picture.
