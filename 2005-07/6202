Sorry for noise again.
I have found two bugs in cvsps that results in the wrong import to git.
I tried to contact developer but it seems that his mail have no mailserver 
ATM. Since he has made some changes for git already - probably someone on 
this list have his new contact. Please tell me it or forward my mail to him. 
Thanks.

For the curious, here are the bugs:
1) some branches fork off too late - cvsps shifts brahches starts forward to 
the future
Example:
http://www.penza-gsm.ru/snake/testscript

2) some branches are not detected at all, not recorded as patchsets and 
consequently not imported into git.
Example (branch "old"):
http://www.penza-gsm.ru/snake/simplexml.py,v
