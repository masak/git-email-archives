Isn't that what a tag is for?

  o Make a sandbox
  o Commit cool changes
  o Tag the last commit object
  o Throw sandbox away.
  o Push changes or generate patch based on the tag

The change is that we can create a sandbox by giving it a starting
point, a tag.  If we decide we want to keep working on this branch,
all we'd have to do is go back to that tag, although I admit it may
seem sloppy to have to create a new branch from a tag'd commit that we
originally part of a branch.
