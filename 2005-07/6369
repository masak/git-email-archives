A very good start indeed.  Thanks.

I think Kevin's comment is valid and his description is reasonable.

I think you would want to drop Darcs and Mercurial from the "on
top" list.  If I understand correctly, Mercurial is
independently written with its own on-disk formats [*1*].  It
would be very unfair to put Darcs in "building on" category.
They've been there for quite some time with their own repository
format and the tools and interfaces are reasonably mature.

Instead, please add gitk and gitweb to the list.  We should not
forget that these "mostly read-only" things are Porcelains.


[Footnote]

*1* It feels that actually it is done right.  Its misfortune is
that many core kernel people have already switched to git.
