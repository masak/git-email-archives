Dear diary, on Wed, Jul 20, 2005 at 06:34:43AM CEST, I got a letter
where James Cloos <cloos+vger-git@jhcloos.com> told me that...

Ah so. Well, yes, the first tag was IIRC weird since it was a tree tag,
not a commit tag. That confused things, but it shouldn't be necessary
anymore since all new tags are hopefully commits. That might somehow
create the local modifications as well, although I don't have a clear
idea how could be that possible. Well, there were some bugs like this in
Cogito in the past, but that should be long fixed.

Thanks anyway,
