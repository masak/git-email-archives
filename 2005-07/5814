I had trouble getting tip.  That may be because I'm on OS X: I want to 
try it on
a Linux box to narrow down the source of my problems.  Given that it's 
currently
4PM on Friday, I don't think the IT staff is going to fix the firewall 
before Monday.
So please excuse me while I scrounge up another Linux box or two.

After that happens, I'll fix up my patches as suggested by you and 
Linus, get
myself a real mailer and resubmit.

thanks,
Bryan
