How about using "git-stripspace"? That's what it's there for. It strips
whitespace from the end of lines, from the beginning, and from the end. It
also removes multiple consecutive whitespace lines from within the body of
the message - which might turn some people off, but I use that same thing
when I do my automated email commits, so if you don't strip those lines
from the email, they _will_ get stripped at commit time, so..

"git-stripspace" also doesn't get confused by non-empty lines that have 
spaces in them, like your script seems to be (ie /^$/ won't match a line 
that has a space on it).
