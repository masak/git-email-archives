As far as I can tell public distributed tags are not that hard and if
you are going to be synching them it is probably worth working on.

The basic idea is that instead of having one global tag of
'linux-2.6.13-rc1' you have a global tag of
'torvalds@osdl.org/linux-2.6.13-rc1'.

The important part is that the tag namespace is made hierarchical
with at least 2 levels.  Where the top level is a globally
unique tag owner id and the bottom level is the actual tag.  This
prevents collisions when merging trees because two peoples
tags are never in the same namespace, as least when
people are not actively hostile :)

Still being a complete git dummy I think the trivial mapping is
to put tags in:
.git/refs/tags/user@domain/tag
and then have a symlink at:
.git/TAGS 
that points to your default directory of tags.
