Yeah, that sounds like me just not having taken my 'meds. The patch looks 
fine.

Yeh. I was wanting to sort the refs to make everything be totally 
repeatable, but that was more of an urge than a real plan.

Yes, warning on ambiguity sounds like a sound plan, and then you don't 
need to sort.

You also probably to come up with a syntax for saying "xyz is the local
name, abc is the remote name". That's needed for both the pulling and the 
pushing side, but I didn't ever do it.

It's "interesting" but useful. But I agree, we've had one bug already due
to the interesting part.

If you do the ambiguity thing, you might mark them used some separate way, 
and maybe avoid that side effect (or rather - the side effect would still 
exist, but instead of removing the entry, it would just mark it as 
"seen", ie make it less drastic).
