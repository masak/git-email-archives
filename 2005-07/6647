Yes, I agree.  I'm happy to send you an email when I have committed
changes to gitk if that will help.

He did ask me first, and I said he could :).  It makes things easier
for me, having gitk in the core git, because it means that I don't
have to worry about making a proper package out of it.  I don't see
any reason why gitk would grow to be more than just the script.

I am also thinking of doing a "gitool", somewhat like bk citool, to
make it easier to create commits.  I guess we can decide later whether
to make it part of the core git, although it seems more like porcelain
than gitk.

Thanks for the patch.  I have committed that fix plus fixes for some
other bugs that people have reported, and pushed it to
master.kernel.org.  Could you do another pull please?

Regards,
Paul.
