Actually, what you really want here is to put in refs/tags/latest the hash
of the tag whose "tag" field is v2.6.13-rc1 (or whatever it is). Having a
tag with the "tag" field of "latest" would be a bit silly, because the
object will probably stay in circulation long after it's no longer
true. And the object itself would tell you that it was the latest version
when it was created (but isn't every version?). That's why you want the
_tag_ to say something useful about the version (maybe "v2.6.12", maybe
just "tested"), and the _ref_ to tell you it's the latest.

The fact that lots of tags get refs named with their contents is just due
to tags only getting used for a small portion of their possible uses. This
only happens when the feature you'd look something up under is a feature
which is persistent.
