Sorry, somehow I just missed that, and then I noticed just a little
before you sent out your email.

I'm having the worst time putting together a mental model of how git
works, and the documentation is spotty enough that it hasn't been
helpful.  So I am wading through the code.  It seems every time I turn
a corner there is another rough spot.

I guess I was expecting to pull from one tree into another unrelated
tree.  Getting a tree with two heads and then be able to merge them
together.

A couple of questions.

1) Does git-clone-script when packed copy the entire repository
   or just take a couple of slices of the tree where you have
   references?

2) Is there a way for a pack to create deltas against objects
   that are not in the tree?  For a dumb repository making incremental
   changes this is ideal.
