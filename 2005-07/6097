Hi,

Attached to this email is a patch that expands the README file a bit, 
including info about basic Cogito commands at the beginning of the file. 
  I also added an distributed VCS paragraph at the beginning for people 
like me who are typically stuck in CVS-land.

Comments/critiques/flames welcome.

I'd also like to include stuff about branches, but I haven't gotten my 
head wrapped around how they work yet.  cg-branch-add expects a location
after the branch name and I'm not sure what to give it.  I have a test 
project containing hello_world.py and was trying to get 2 branches going 
and be able to switch between them.  What do you use for a location in 
this case?  I tried using ".", but switching between branches didn't 
seem to have any affect.

On another note, I thought I heard that man pages are desired.  Is the a 
certain group of commands I should start with?  Do you want dirt simple 
man pages, or are you looking for some <insert-buzzword-here> formatted 
source docs?

Jerry

+This document describes the Cogito VCS as well as GIT.  The GIT itself

+If you've only used a centralized version control system like CVS
+before, this package may require a change in how you visualize source
+code management.  With Cogito/GIT, every directory with a checked out
+project is also a repository for that project.  When you commit your
+changes, you are committing them into the repository in the current
+directory, not to the main repository.  In order to have your changes
+show up in the main repository they need to be merged in by a person
+that manages that repository.  This can either be done by mailing them
+a patch containing your changes or by giving them access to your 
+repository and having them pull in your changes.
