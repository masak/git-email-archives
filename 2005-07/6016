There is also the commit path, and that comes from C.  I'm not
quite certain how we should be using the environmental variables.

Make sense.  Although I'm not quite certain we actually need the
information twice.  Possibly we just have GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, and then have commit-write take a flag to
override the author bit.  That would certainly make it less
confusing when setting up environmental variables for git.
And that would also give us a better name.

Part of the request was to put all of this information together
in a common place.  And note that it is actually:
tagger="$GIT_COMMITTER_NAME <$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL> $GIT_COMMITTER_DATE"
Where the date is a human unreadable string of the number of seconds
since the epoch (aka 1 Jan 1970 UTC).

Agreed.  Something like git-author or git-author-stamp is probably
better.

And in git-commit-script this is actually parsed by sed which makes
it so the shell can parse the information as well so I think
we are fine in that sense.
