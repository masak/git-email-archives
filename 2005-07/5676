Dear diary, on Wed, Jul 06, 2005 at 09:00:50AM CEST, I got a letter
where Frank Sorenson <frank@tuxrocks.com> told me that...
> Here is a patch to add a commify function to cg-Xlib.  I'll follow 
> this up with a patch that uses the new function to commify the 
> number and size of objects pulled in cg-pull.

I don't know. Could you give some supporting argumentation, please? Is
it really that hard to read for the Americans without the commas? It is
at least harder to read for me as an European - we don't have any
commas in there, just spaces (if anything at all). Besides, the number
is usually not in higher order than thousands, so... why is it worth it?
