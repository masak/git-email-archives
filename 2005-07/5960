I think we can replace "xargs -r" with just plain "xargs". It results in 
an empty "rm -f", but hey, that's ok. If some broken "rm" complains about 
that (GNU rm doesn't), you can always do

	find .. | xargs rm -f dummy-file.o

which makes sure that we have a dummy argument even for an empty list..

I don't see a good alternative for "cp -l".

I also don't see why, if OS-X already _does_ include the GNU tools, they 
couldn't be under /opt/fsf/bin or something like that, and then you could 
just do

	PATH=/opt/fsf/bin:$PATH

and be done with it.

Grumble.
