One old farts comment re the docs here folks.

This will need to be improved considerably if you want all us lurking 
frogs to be able to use it without drowning this list with what 
really should be RTFMable questions.  Specifically, we should be able 
to dl one package and install something that, by reading the 
manpages, can be made to work OOTB given an adequate network 
connection.

My lurking & reading the mail here tends to give me the impression 
that while it can be made to work, there are yet rough edges for the 
new user.  Potentially discouraging rough edges...
