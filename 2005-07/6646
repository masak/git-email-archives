Actually, this is the part of GregKH's script which I hate ;)

50 patches sent this way produce an enormous email thread; if someone
then tries to comment on a 40th patch, this part of the thread ends up
far behind the right edge of the message list window in almost any mail
client (and if someone comments on the first patch, the comments are far
from that patch).

Sending a [PATCH 0/N] message with the overall description of the
patchset and then all patches as replies to that message looks much
better in that respect.  However, missing messages in this form are less
obvious.
