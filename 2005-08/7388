Patches are definitely meant to be part of how git is used; they are the
primary way of getting clean history out of messy history (that is, saving
a content change while discarding some history that isn't applicable).
There's relatively little support in git itself, but that's because the
point is to go outside the system's tracking. There have been various
discussions of more explicit support, and nobody's been able to come up
with a need.

I'd guess that git-diff-tree + git-apply (without the rest of the
scripting) would be more effective when you're not doing anything with the
intermediate files, since it saves doing a bunch of formatting and
parsing.
