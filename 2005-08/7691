I think it's the right thing to do for now (and what I was going to
suggest), and if people find it too slow, we can consider teaching
read-tree to take multiple common ancestors and use any of them that gives
clear result on a per-file basis.

On the other hand, Tony might have hit a bad case with an ill-chosen
common ancestor for a patch/revert sequence, and we probably want to look
into that if we've got some history that demonstrates the problem. I think
that, if there are two common ancestors, one of which has applied a patch
and one of which hasn't, and on one side of the merge it gets reverted, we
should get the revert, but we'll only get it if we choose the ancestor
where it was applied.

(Letters are versions of the file, which 'b' being the bad patch; the
 second column is the two choices for common ancestor)

  a-b-a-?
 / X   /
a-b-b-b

Of course, you could have the two lines exactly flipped for a different
file in the same commits, or for a different hunk in the same file, and
there would be no single choice that doesn't lose the revert. The really
right thing to do is identify that there is a b->a transition that is not
a trivial merge and that is not beyond a common ancestor, but that's hard
to determine easily and with sufficient granularity to catch everything.

I still someday want to do a version of diff/merge for git that could
select common ancestors on a per-hunk basis and identify block moves and
avoid giving confusing (but marginally shorter) diffs, but that's a major
undertaking that I don't have time for right now.
