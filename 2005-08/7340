This adds essentially the same logic to local-pull that http-pull has, 
with the exception that it reads the index out of the source directory, 
rather than copying it. This, in turn, requires the ability to use an 
index file in some other directory.

 1: Use index file in another directory
 2: Copy/link/symlink pack files as appropriate
