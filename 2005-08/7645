Hello,

Here's a thought.  It might be nice, in this situation, to have
something like a git-undo-script that can undo the changes in the index
storing them in a tree object but not wrapping them into a commit.  A
ref to the tree can be stored in an 'undo' file somewhere under .git.
When the merge is done then a git-redo-script can retrieve and merge
that tree back into the index.  This way, cg-{merge,update} could refuse
--- which I tend to think it should --- to merge into a dirty tree but
it wouldn't be so inconvenient.

cogito would handle synchronization with the working copy like normal.

Carl
