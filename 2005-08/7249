Yes.  There is one shortcoming in the current git-clone -s in
the proposed updates branch.  If the parent repository has
alternates on its own, that information should be copied to the
cloned one as well (e.g. Jeff has alternates pointing at you,
and I clone from Jeff with -s flag --- I should list not just
Jeff but also you to borrow from in my alternates file).

Yes.  Another possibility is to use git-relink which was written
exactly to solve this in a different way.
