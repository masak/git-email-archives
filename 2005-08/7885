It reduces the disk space requirement significantly (linux packs from
135MB to 73MB), and I'm seeing speed improvements as well (probably
because cache-cold operation requires far less seeking, and the caching
requirements are smaller).

What are the benefits to keeping old packs?

I disagree about not removing old packs.  When you "repack" your
suitcase, you take everything out and put it back in again, so a command
named "repack" should remove all existing objects, and put them back again.

Okay, so the pack algorithm could be better, but that only means that
repacking the entire set of objects would improve things more, making
some sort of "git-repack-all" an even more valuable operation.
