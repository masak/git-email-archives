Okay; I think the only thing that I'm going to change with respect to how
it makes decisions will be with 4+ trees, and those will obviously need
new tests,

For each path, I intend to look at all the entries and make trivial merge
judgements on them, but then only leave the usual stage 2 and stage 3, and
a chosen stage 1. The way I'm writing the changes is:

In the argument parsing loop, just form a list of the tree objects, and
actually read them after the whole list is ready. If there are more than
3, ignore all but the last 3. This lets you give an arbitary number of
common ancestors to read-tree, and it won't mess up, but it will only use
one of them. I've done this.

Next, scan through the tree entry lists for all the trees together, and
generate cache entries for the same path in the different trees at the
same time. I've written this, but I've got a few bugs, and the 3way merge
tests are dutifully failing.

Then, I'll do the trivial merge on tree entries rather than cache
entries.

Finally, I'll extend the trivial merge to use the extra ancestors.

Since merge(1) doesn't handle multiple common ancestors, having more than
3 stages in the cache after the trivial merge isn't going to be useful for
now.
