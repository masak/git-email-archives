Well, I was really responding to the comment about "-script" being
better than ".sh", as trying ".sh", ".pl", ".php", etc, would rapidly
be annoying.

Honestly, I think the biggest argument against the "-script" suffix is
related to man-page usage:  It requires significant knowledge of the Git
project to figure out what name variant to use to find the man page.

(There are other problems with man pages, but I'll address those
seperately now that they have occurred to me.)
