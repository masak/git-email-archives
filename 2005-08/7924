My understanding is that he is enhancing the current three-way
merge 'read-tree -m O A B' "we are at A and have come from O; we
would like to apply changes made by somebody who went from O to
A" to 'read-tree -m O1,O2,O3,... A B' to mean "any of the O_n
are merge-base candidates".  I think having multiple "stage 1"
is useful for what Daniel is doing.

I suspect you are solving a different problem here --- an
Octopus.

But I agree that the current way of doing things in stage 2 and
stage 3 is special casing two head merges from an Octopus, and
there might not be a fundamental reason for doing so.  Folding
the current stage 2 and 3 into a single "merge target stage",
treating current stage 1 as "merge base stage", and allowing
duplicate entries in both stages might turn out to make more
sense.  I suspect this would break a lot of tools initially, but
that is part of the process of making progress.

The same rule should apply to multiple stage 1 entries to
represent multiple candidate merge bases.
