hmm, I must have misted those threads, I'll try to find and read them.

I agree that such history should not be imported into the mainline, but such
history would still be very usefull when these patches won't be pushed to
mailine immediately. Also, when pushing to mainline, this history can easily
be removed by removing the branch/patch/parent files and refreshing (this
should off course be automated)

hmm, not exactly, for example, when reordering the patches (including the
top one), I would like to see this in gitk.
Or when a patch has been dropped (amongst a lot of patches), it should be
easily spotted.


But even if the "stg-freeze" would not be incorporated into stgit, would it
still be possible to include some sort of extra parents directory. So that
the freeze can be implemented on top of stgit?

TIA
