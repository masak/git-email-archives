Hi Kay.

When browsing http://www.kernel.org/git I often find myself looking for
the most recently changed tree.
For this it is very good that you have the "last change" in italic and
bolded if newer than a few hours (I think).

A nice additional feature would be the possibility to sort the output
according to last change, owner and description.
Using a click-able table heading would be the most intuitive way.

I have not looked into the source for gitweb, so I really do not know
how difficult this would be.


	Sam
