I did something a little easier - if you click on the tag, it now
displays the contents of the tag in the details pane.  Is that good
enough?

Well, Tk can display inline images in text widgets... :)

I implemented these two.  There is now a "Reread references" button in
the File menu.  References other than tags and heads get displayed in
a light blue box.

Hmmm... now I suppose we want a way to use gitk to drive the git
bisection process... :)
