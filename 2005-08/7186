I used cogito to do a cg-update and got conflicts and the exact files are
printed to the screen. But say I somehow lost that output is there anyway
to list conflicting files ??

cg-status shows the files as modified but that also includes non
conflicting files.

The best I could find was to do a "git-update-cache --refresh" but that
still do not tell me if I already have removed the conflict in the file.

Is this not something that needs to be answered if we ever are going to
have a graphical merge tool?
