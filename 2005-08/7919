I should have mentioned before, these changes are being used in a
SourcePuller dump file to git import script I've been working on.

The test was the problem it tried to work with empty files.

> * Fix the processing of multiple patch files with --check in git-apply.
> * New option --ignore-applied for git-apply.

I've fixed up the problems with these patches and rebased them.

> * New option --ignore-whitespace for git-apply.

This change was just wrong and could cause file corruption, I've got
another version in the works which fixes the problem and adds some of
the suggested features.
