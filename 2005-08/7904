Nope, I don't think so.

The only actual filesystem _breakage_ has been the introduction of 
pack-files (and the old, old _old_ thing where I changed the actual object 
compression/hashing order).

The "objects/info/alternates" thing is an extension, which allows you to 
have a partial object store, and point to the "rest of it", and still have 
all the tools understand it and be able to parse the totality of it. So it 
doesn't break or change old formats, it only allows a new one.

(Partial repos have always worked with the rsync protocol, and with the
client-side pulling. But that was more of an accident than anything else,
and they fundamentally were broken for any real work - gitweb can't show
anything really sane, server-side serving - whether anonymous or ssh -
doesn't work, etc etc).
