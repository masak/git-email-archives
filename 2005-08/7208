Dear diary, on Sat, Aug 13, 2005 at 09:41:45PM CEST, I got a letter

If we have rename patches, why couldn't our patches deal with
directories as well? And git-apply, cg-patch etc might have a way to
behave in a "traditional" way for non-git patches and if a patch removes
all files in a directory, kill the directory.

That is, I would solve this on the SCM<->patches boundary, not
fundamentally limit the SCM itself.
