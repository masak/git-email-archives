Yes, this would be best.  Linus was resistant to this idea, but maybe
Junio will be sympathetic?

I'll once again suggest "lit", for "Linu{x,s} Information Tracker",
meaning "filled with light", "on fire", and "drunk".


While we're at it, renaming cogito's "cg" to "cog" would fix another
filename conflict in Debian, and would give the right hand something to
do while the left hand seeks from c to g.  ;-)
