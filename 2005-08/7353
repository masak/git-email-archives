I haven't seen this problem myself. There are some recent patches
Junio merged that handle some oddities better. Give the 'pu' branch a
go if you can.

I take it that the repo is not public. I'd like to try and reproduce
the problem. Can you get it to happen with a public repository?

For debugging, I'd say proofread the cvsps output, see ~/.cvsps/#repo
. that could give you hints as to the 'nameless' branches. Why is
origin missing is a different problem.

Ah! Important: if you're adding debugging statements by hand, bear in
mind that part of the code is executed in a forked child process, and
prints there will mess things up.

cheers,


martin
