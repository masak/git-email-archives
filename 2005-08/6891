I haven't had a chance to investigate this much
yet but I have ran into a peculiar problem.

I was trying to help someone track down a bug that
occurred between linux-2.6.12 and linux-2.6.13-rc1.
Since it was very much an unknown where the problem
was introduced I decided to run git format-patch
so I could see what all of the differences were.
Then to be certain the patch series worked I started
applying them in order.  

I didn't get very far when I had a patch conflict.

Looking deeper git-diff-tree is always making the diffs
against the parent instead of against the next commit
in the series.  Which is largely sane.  However it does
not warn or fail when the parents and the next commit are different,
which seems nonintuitive.
