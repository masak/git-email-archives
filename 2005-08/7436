Ok, but do you have an answer to my real question?  What is the
character encoding for commit objects in your git repository?

It is obviously one that is compatible with ASCII, which probably
leaves you with the alternatives ASCII, Latin1, and UTF-8.  And plain
ASCII obviously doesn't work very well for me.
