ooooo. Tricky.

Thanks for the script. That's a bad, bad hack. :-)

What I'm going to do is actually an inversion of that. Publishing a
repository with the _intent_ of being merged into existing history, and
observing obvious naming conventions as the "prior arrangement".

I thought once I got the initial baseless merges done and committed that
I do fetch-octopus from that point on. But octopus was still complaining
about not finding a merge base. I'm going to verify that I didn't just
mess something up in the process.

If I can get octopus working as the tool for doing merges _after_ the
baseless merges then I can live with the current situation.
