Instead of disabling it entirely, how about just having some limit on it?

The basic rename detection works very well for "normal" changes as you 
point out, but it very fundamentally is O(n^2) in number of files created 
and deleted, so we could instead just limit it and say "if we have tons of 
new/deleted files, disable it in the interest of CPU/memory usage".
