When I say 'you always round trip to MAIN', I mean you send patches 
upstream and someone commits to MAIN, then you pull from MAIN.

Sorry if it was not clear.

When I said 'more people can commit to the stable branch' I meant more 
people sends patches to a mantainer that commits the patches in a stable branch.

Sorry, peraphs also this was not clearly expressed.

Yes, you better explained what I was badly trying to say before.

I was thinking at two different kind of workflow, one were you are tracking a 
remote repository ( Linux kernel project like ) and one as single developer with 
both stable and develop lines ( qgit or StGIT ;-) projects like ). 

You clarified me for both cases.

Thanks
