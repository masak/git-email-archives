Greetings,

My appologies if this has already been discussed.  I've been through the
archives but could easily have missed something.

I have found it useful in the past to have the ability to add an empty
directory to the repository.  With what little I know about git it seems
that this is entirely possible.  It would create an empty tree object
for the new directory and insert a reference to that in the parent tree
object.

If someone could get me started I think I could find the time to create
and submit a patch to allow this.  Here is what I've tried (with
0.99.4).

% mkdir test
% cd test
% git-init-db
% mkdir dir
% git-add-script dir
error: open("dir"): No such file or directory
fatal: Unable to add dir to database

Cheers,
Carl
