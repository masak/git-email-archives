Maybe also something in format-patch to check that the commit has one? I, 
at least, tend to have unsigned commits for tracking stuff I've done but 
not cleaned up and signed ones that I want to send off as patches. I've 
confused the branches on occasion, although never when sending stuff, and 
it would be nice to have format-patch tell you if the commit didn't look 
right.
