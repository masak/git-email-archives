I don't know if this is what you mean, but if you right click on a free 
lane (i.e. not a bullet but a vertical line) on the graph you should see a
pop-up with selectable childs and parent.

I will try to proceed from (a) to, eventually, (b).

Ok, I will try to use straight horizontal lines instead of jump-over-bumps. If
this seems not enough clear I will add an option to switch visualization.

No, just a setting. Not a problem to set "No wrap" behaviour. I will set this
also in diff viewer window.

You discover a real bug ;-). I never intended to modify commit comments in any way.

The logic here is to specify a range. As example if you have following commits

      A
      B
      C
      D
      E
      F

and you select B and E then 3 patches will be created: 
 
     patch_1(diff between D-E)
     patch_2(diff between C-D)
     patch_3(diff between B-C) 

So you need at least 2 selected revs. Put in other words, the base is always explicit.
