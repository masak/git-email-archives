When the tree status looks good, you could tag it and the whole stack
(the commits corresponding to the patches) would be available via this
tag.

As I said, I agree with the idea of freezing a patch and even having
multiple parents to a commit but this commit should not be visible via
HEAD. We could have another id for a patch, 'frozen', which stores the
last frozen state with the parents being the previous frozen
states. Its SHA1 value could be accessed via 'stg id <patch>/frozen'
(in the same way as /top and /bottom ids).
