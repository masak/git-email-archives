I think we only need at most two names for this, so this is more a matter
of fixing old usage than documenting it.

Well, it often contains information not present anywhere else (the status
of a merge; the set of files being committed, added, or removed), so it
isn't really a cache at all.

You probably don't need to mention that tree objects and index files can
be thought of as filesystems, but you should specify that the working tree
really is in the Unix filesystem, in case people have heard of the idea.

It should be clear to say 'You can "cd" there and "ls" to list your
files.', rather than 'Think "ls -laR"' which makes my think of the output,
which is like the output from git-ls-files.

Ah, okay.

Right; I think we should change the name of the script.
