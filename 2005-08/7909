Yeah, this works only if all the trees are in one directory. The index file
is a simple list with the pathes url encoded. (It is exported by a cron job
running on kernel.org. We need it there cause the trees are in subdirs and
the mirrored trees don't have the original ownership, that is displayed in
gitweb.)

So let's do it in perl then. :) Just encode the pathes and put them into
the file (optionaly the owner comes after a space in the same line):
  perl -e 'use CGI; print CGI::escape("/this/is/my/project") . "\n"'
  %2Fthis%2Fis%2Fmy%2Fproject

Good luck,
Kay
