I'd originally proposed the .git/info directory because I keep multiple
working trees for the same repository, by having symlinks for .git/objects
and .git/refs, and I could also get other per-repository things to be
shared properly without knowing exactly what they are if they're in a
subdirectory of .git that could be a symlink. This would mean that a
".git/config" would be per-working-tree, like .git/index or .git/HEAD, not
pre-repository like ".git/info/config". Of course, the core didn't have
any thing to go in .git/info at the time, so it didn't really get tacked
down.

(I find it convenient to have mainline and my latest work both checked out
for reference while I'm generating a series of commits for a patch set,
and I don't want three different repositories which could be out of sync;
this also keeps the repository safely out of pwd, since I have the actual
repositories as ~/git/{project}.git/)
