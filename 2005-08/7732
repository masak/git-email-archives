Perhaps link the 'howto' docs from the git formal docs, so they are
visible via http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/

Yup, run trial conversions for about half a dozen cvs repos, and
currently tracking external cvs projects with git too. Will update
docs as I find time.

I recently wrote one such 'shared repo' tutorial for internal
consumption at work. Should clean it up, and add to the howto dir. The
incentive here would be to see the howtos on the web - and then I can
point people at it directly.

Personally, I want to complete the Arch import. I'm interested in
feedback on the current code -- anyone has an interest in migration
from Arch or similar patch-centric SCM?

cheers,
