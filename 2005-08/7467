That depends on what the rules are, but I consider detecting B
encodings in the header fields and transliterating it into UTF-8
a good idea (although that sometimes is a lossy conversion
depending on the original charset).

Remember this one that prompted me to do the header folding?

I agree with you in principle and that is why I always run
applymbox with the -q flag.  Maybe I should start trying the
baseball bat approach to see what happens.
