Oops, I did intend to add just that to .git/branches/myremotebranch.

This sounds good.

I don't doubt the utility of these topic branches.  In fact, I think it
what he's doing with this is great.  This is exactly the kind of thing
the 'relationships' could help out with.

As he creates branches from existing branches, pushes, pulls and merges
between them the relationships files would maintain a record of this.
Let's say, for example, he made a change on speed-up-spinlocks and
merged it to test.  Later, a bug is found and he fixes the bug on the
speed-up-spinlocks branch.  Now, a script could run using the
relationships files that could immediately tell that the test branch is
behind the speed-up-spinlocks branch and that they should be merged.
For someone who has a lot of different things to do this will be
valuable.

I would leave maintenance of any static work flows up to the porcelains.
If a project chose to use some sort of static flow then it can simply
populate the relationships files to help drive pushing and pulling if
some rogue developer were to use git alone or some other porcelain (thus
maintaining compatibility between porcelains).  If a porcelain wanted to
be very strict about adherance to a static flow then checking the
relationships could tell if something 'bad' has been done outside of
that porcelain.

I hope I'm being clear.  Please let me know if something is not clear.

Carl
