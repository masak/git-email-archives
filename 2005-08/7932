Well, I didn't actually veto it when I saw the feature the first time, 
because I think it's a valid thing to do when applying patches by hand.

It was only when I realized that Robert was trying to use it to import 
from somewhere else that it became broken. An import should use the most 
anal patches possible.

Actually, an import should preferably never use patches at all, since that
never really works for binary data. This is why the CVS importer actually
checks out full files and imports them that way. The patch-based ones will 
fundamentally always have problems.
