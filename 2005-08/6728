In testing this, I think I figured out *why* the former is preferred -
it guarantees the sorting when in the standard mode of "order by date".

Since these emails are sent *very* fast, delivery order tends to be the
dominating factor in how they sort in your inbox, as they will all have
the same time.  So that's a trifle annoying.

Yes, sorting by subject will fix it, but "threaded + subject" is
actually something I'm not sure much of anything supports.  (It's not
instantly obvious how to do it in mutt, for example - though,
admittedly, Mutt may very well have a way to do it.)

I noticed this while testing my 2 new fixes - those will sent in a few
seconds.
