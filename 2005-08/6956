We should discuss (or just do) a reorganization of how we lay out the
source tree.

There's probably a few too many files in the top directory, from all the
porcelain we've built on the plumbing. (heh)

I haven't really given a lot of thought to this yet, but I was thinking
of something along these lines:

Rename tools/ to mail-tools/, push git-send-email-script into that.
Create a "porcelain" directory for things like git-bisect-script
Create a "core" directory for things like "git-commit-script"
Create a "src" (?) directory for *.[ch]
Maybe move documentation into the same directory as the scripts they
belong to.

Then we can argue over where the leftover things fall.

If we can get the directory structure to make sense and start putting
new things into the right spots, the exact location of where *current*
things end up is probably not so important.

I consider this post 1.0 material, personally.
