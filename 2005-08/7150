Actually, if HPA can (or has) work out the kinks for combining the object 
stores for different projects I think you will find that a site like 
sourceforge could actually find that across all their differnt projects 
git will require significantly less space then first thought. I believe 
that there is a significant number of files that are going to be the same 
in different project (for example COPYING, or if a project is forked, most 
of the files in a project) and therfor will just refer to the same object 
blob.

now when you start makeing packs this sort of thing can make the optimal 
logic for deciding what's in each pack 'interesting', but as long as each 
pack is self contained the rest of the git tools will handle things just 
fine.
