Just to confirm a recent answer to questions on lkml ...

1) There is no way to send a particular changeset from the "middle" of a 
set from one tree to another, without exporting it as a patch or 
rebuilding a new git tree.   I have two changesets that, after testing 
last week, I now consider more important to send upstream than the few 
earlier and later changesets.   If I export those two changesets as 
patches, and send them on. presumably I lose the changset comments etc. 
and then when the upstream tree is merged back, it might look a little 
odd in the changeset history.

2) There is no way to update the comment field of a changeset after it 
goes in (e.g. to add a bugzilla bug number for a bug that was opened 
just after the fix went in).

3) There is no way to do a test commit of an individual changeset 
against a specified tree (to make sure it would still merge cleanly, 
automatically).

Are there easier ways to do any of these?
