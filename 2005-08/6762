You can't. It's fundamentally not doable, because you lose the merge 
information.

So you need to use a combination of git-rev-list _and_ git-whatchanged.

Use the "--parents" flag to git-rev-list to get the parents output for 
doing your own graph, if you want to.

I have been thinking of adding a "follow this file" mode to git-rev-list,
which just ignores all children of merges that used the file directly from
one of the other children. Exactly because then you could have a
git-rev-list that prunes based on filename, and would potentially be a lot
more efficient (not follow the "uninteresting" side of a merge).

I haven't gotten around to it, partly because I wonder if it would be
better as a separate program - even if that would mean that you'd lose all
the cool features of git-rev-list (the ability to limit it to certain
versions, and the ability to sort the output in relevant orders).

Partly because I'm just too friggin lazy.

Nope, this is a direct result of two branches modifying the same file in 
parallel. There is no "right" or "wrong" order.
