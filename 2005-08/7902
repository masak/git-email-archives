I tried 'git checkout ben_dev_rfcnt'.  It took a few seconds and
had no errors.  But, the files created on my other branch still
exist in the code tree, and I still see my patch in the
existing files..  I would expect them to go away.

I don't think I've managed to commit anything to any branch yet...  Could that
be part of the problem?

I tried gitk -all, and get this error popup:

Gitk: error reading commits: bad arguments to git-rev-list.
(Note: arguments to gitk are passed to
git-rev-list
to allow selection of commits to be displayed.)

Thanks,
Ben
