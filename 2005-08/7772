Wrong as of last week ;-), and definitely wrong since this morning.

What Linus suggests is doable by using an object that can hold
a pointer to at least one commit---you used that to record the
head commit of the corresponding git branch that the arch
metainfo represents.

You only pull arch metainfo branch; the objects associated with
the corresponding git branch head will be pulled together when
you pull it.  You do not have to tell git to pull git-part of
the commit chain.  There is no need to worry about version skew
when you use git this way.

Now, among the existing object types, there are only two kinds
of objects you can use for this.  If the only thing you need to
record is some textual information with one pointer to git
branch head, then you can use tag that points at the git head,
and store everything else as the tag comment.  This is doable
but unwieldy.

You could abuse a commit object as well; you store commit
objects (such as the corresponding git branch head) as parent
commits, and put everything else in a tree that is associated
with that commit.
