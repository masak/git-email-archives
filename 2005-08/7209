I don't know, but I come across fuzzy patches quite frequently and any
problems have been always _extremely_ rare. And in any case, I can (and
do) verify it right away by doing cg-diff and checking what changes did
the patch really do.

That reminds me I should finally add support for renames to cg-patch...
