Dear diary, on Sat, Aug 13, 2005 at 07:30:43PM CEST, I got a letter
where Carl Baldwin <cnb@fc.hp.com> told me that...

the object databases supports it, but the index file does not. But yes,
it should be supported, I think.

Some argue that this is useless, so some practical example of its
usefulness might be a good motivation to get us going. :-)
