Dear diary, on Wed, Aug 03, 2005 at 07:11:00PM CEST, I got a letter
where barkalow@iabervon.org told me that...

I want to use it in Cogito again, since copying everything obviously
sucks and I want to hardlink, so repacking is not a solution either.
Didn't you post some patches to fix this long time ago, actually?
