I think this is great - especially for places like kernel.org, where a lot 
of repos end up being related to each other, yet independent.

However, exactly for places like kernel.org it would _also_ be nice if
there was some way to prune objects that have been merged back into the
parent. In other words, imagine that people start using my kernel tree as
their source of "alternate" objects, which works wonderfully well, but
then as I pull from them, nothing ever removes the objects that are now
duplicate.

We've got a "git prune-packed", it would be good to have a "git
prune-alternate" or something equivalent.
