Yes, this does the job nicely.  I've used it like this effectively.  I
meant for undo/redo to be a lighter weight way of moving (uncommitted)
changes out of the way briefly and then replaying them onto the working
directory later.

The "stack" was the wrong thing to do.  I think I would have undo pick a
name like undo-1, undo-2 etc.  Or something like that.  redo would pick
the most recent unless told to do otherwise.

A possible advantage of undo is having the freedom to stay on the
current branch or switch to another.

This brings up a good point (indirectly).  "git prune" would destroy the
undo objects.  I had thought of this but decided to ignore it for the
time being.
