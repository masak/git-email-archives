ok, with '--full' nothing gets reported as dangling.  That commit is not
in a pack, but is in an object directory referenced through
objects/info/alternates.

yes, master == origin and that commit is reachable from master according
to gitk.

It is still reachable as fsck-cache --full shows (I guess).
