Dear diary, on Sat, Aug 06, 2005 at 09:14:03AM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...

Hello,

no problem, and sorry for another delay on my side too. :-)

Yes, that makes sense.

Is that fixed already?

It became much simpler a short while later, thankfully. Judging from
your another patch, I suppose you are going to update this script
accordingly?

Perhaps add "and their contents" to prevent bad surprises.

Why can't you use git-ls-files | IFS=$'\n' while ?

An error message would be in order otherwise, I guess.

I suppose you mean continue? I'm not really sure what does return do
here, if it jumps out of the do block or what, and continue is nicely
explicit. :-)
