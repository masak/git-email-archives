Of course this breaks qgit interface to git-format-patch-script
but if you think it's better this way....

I think it's ugly too, in this early phase of git development 
better go with proper solution then compatibility compromises.

A suggestion I would like to present is if can be useful a
kind of scheduling/list of planned compatibility break features so
 that developers can know in advance when and what will break
 their stuff and users can know when they will need to upgrade.
