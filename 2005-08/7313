I was seriously considering just breaking the "remote cvs" support
entirely (you can always just use cvsup or something to download it to
make it local), and just taking the RCS parsing code from GNU rcs/cvs and
making a C language CVS importer. That would speed things up by an order
of magnitude or more, as far as I can tell.
