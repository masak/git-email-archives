Dear diary, on Sun, Aug 07, 2005 at 12:34:36AM CEST, I got a letter
where Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org> told me that...
> I accidently commited too many files to my tree today, and now I want to
> drop the commit so I have logically separate commits.
> 
> What is the right way to do this - in cogito hopefully.
> 
> I do not mind to execute a few git commands, but for my daily usage I
> expect cogito to hanle everything and dropping a commit has proved
> useful for me from time to time, so I expect it be be implemented in the
> porcelain somehow.
> 
> I have read the help for cg-seek - but it di not convince me to be what
> I seeked.

cg-admin-uncommit, be sure to read --help first. Linus' pruning notes
apply as well, cg-admin-uncommit won't delete it from the database
(I personally don't care about that and never pruned so far).
