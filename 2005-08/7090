Dear diary, on Fri, Aug 12, 2005 at 02:54:13AM CEST, I got a letter

well, I did quite a while ago. Unless the kernel.org mirroring system
broke, it should be already public.

In the long term, I would prefer to have directory information in the
index file - to make this kind of tasks easier, allow juggling with
empty directories etc.

Yes, we should certainly follow the index, otherwise you will e.g. lose
the files added by cg-add but not committed yet.
