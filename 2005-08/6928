OK, I wasn't that clear. Currently git-fetch-script stores the fetched
head in the FETCH_HEAD file and git-pull-script uses this file to do
the merging (by passing its content to git-resolve-script). Anyway, I
can easily change StGIT to only use git-pull-script directly, without
the intermediate fetch.

It might be hard to deal with conflicts resulted from merging N > 2
heads at the same time. I suspect it would call 'merge' (diff3) for
every new head but it might not be that obvious which head merging
failed (it depends on how you implement it). A way of continuing the
merge for the rest of the fetched heads after a failure needs to be
available.
