A couple of people noticed that the latest commit in the
"master" branch seems, eh, odd.

It was not a screw-up of any of the git tools, just me screwing
up in an early morning/late night editing session when checking
things in.

    $ git whatchanged -p --max-count=1 <that commit>

shows the true story.  The commit message has the excess, but
the patch for the commit has exactly the thing I wanted it to
have and nothing else.

My policy is not to rewind "master" and "rc" once it hits the
public repository; otherwise it would make pulling from these
branches unnecessarily confusing for other people.

Although it is embarrassing, the screw-up this case is only the
commit log message, and running "git revert" once and then "git
revert" again would not make it less confusing, so I will keep
things as they are.
