Another thing that may (or may not) help would be to move that
prepare_temp_file() and stuff to happen in the forked child
process instead of the parent, so that we do not have to worry
about freeing the buffer; it has been some time since I worked
on that part of the code so this may not be an option to make
things easier.

No.  I was talking about cleaning up the similar option parsing
code, and the call into diffcore_std() which takes more
arguments every time a new option is added to the family.
