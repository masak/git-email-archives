The only problem I can see with this is that it's likely to generate
conflicts between the shared heads, and the user is going to be confused
trying to resolve them, because the files with the conflicts will be
missing all of the more recent changes. Other than that, I think it should
give the right answer, although it will presumably involve a lot of
ancient history doing the internal merge. (Which would probably be really
painful if you've got two branches that cross-merge regularly and never
actually completely sync)

I'm getting pretty close to having a version of read-tree that does the
trivial merge portion based comparing the sides against all of the shared
heads. I think yours will be better for the cases we've identified, giving
the correct answer for Tony's case rather than reporting a conflict, but
it's clearly more complicated. I think my changes are worthwhile anyway,
since they make the merging logic more central, but obviously
insufficient.

I've been thinking that could be useful to have read-tree figure out the
history itself, instead of being passed ancestors, in which case it could
use your method, except more efficiently (and only look further at the
history when needed).
