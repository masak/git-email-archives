    Just out of curiosity, why isn't the SHA1 of 'A' part of the
diff or patch format?  I mean it can't be that hard to add it as a
single line of data that git can parse to extract that piece of
information.  Then a patch would enable you to do the 3-way merge
you describe.  If added properly "regular" patch would just ignore
that line.  The patch would then record that it is relative to 'A'.

    Assuming git could be taught "git-merge-patch" and then take use
the patch that's saved during the "undo" step and has the anchor for
the patch to use as the pivot point (as described above).  Life
should be good.  There are probably corner cases I don't understand,
but it sure looks like if you have the pivot or anchor point for the
patch embedded in the patch, you have all the needed information to
pull this off.

    I would think this would be generally useful outside of the
context of "undo/redo" also.
