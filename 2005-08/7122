I like your version.

My misguided attempt was not the ability to pull multiple heads, but what 
to _do_ with them. I originally envisioned something more "git-push-pack" 
like, where it would pull multiple heads into real references, and _that_ 
was the misguided part. I then ended up just printing it out to stdout, 
and that made it "one ref only".

Your version where you just print out multiple heads with names is, I 
think, the right thing to do.

The shell script looks a bit unreadable to me, personally.

Back-ticks, and the ":" operator to "expr". You really _are_ old-fashioned 
when it comes to shell ;)

Wouldn't it be simpler/cleaner to just do

	head=($(git-fetch-pack "$merge_repo" "$merge_head"))

which gets you "$head" being the same as ${head[0]}, namely the SHA1 you 
want (and if you ever implement multi-head pulling, you'll have it all in 
${head[..]}..)
