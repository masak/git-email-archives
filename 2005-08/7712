I would actually argue that

	git checkout -b newbranch <undo-point>

is the perfect undo.

It leaves the old state in the old branch, and creates a new branch (and
checks it out) with the state you want to revert to. The advantage is
exactly that there is no "stack" of undo's: you can have multiple
independent undo's pending, and you can continue development at any of 
them. And merge the results together.

Of course, right now we don't have a "delete branch" command, but it's 
really as simple as

	rm .git/refs/heads/branchname

(and eventually you may want to do a "git prune" to get rid of stale
objects, but that's a separate issue).
