This obviously is not even a fair assesment of the potential
popularity of this new kernel package admin tool.  By holding to this
attitude, you will surely alienate linux users away from debian.

If so far, only 114 people out of the 7147 who were kind enough to
fill out a questionaire have installed the debian 'git' and 24 report
that they are using this tool, then obviously once a stable release of
the Linus version of git has been achieved, the user count of the new
tool will handily exceed the user count of the older and totally
different toolkit from gnu.  This will occur within 24 hours of a
working, stable release of the Linus git.  Possibly aleady has
occured, I have it (the rpm) here already.

Methinks its a good time for one or the other to come up with a new
name.
