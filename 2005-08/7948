I'm testing bisection to find a bug that causes my G5 to no longer boot, 
and during the process have found this command line very nice:

	gitk bisect/bad --not $(cd .git/refs ; ls bisect/good-*)

it basically shows the state of bisection with the known bad commit as the 
top, and cutting off all the good commits - so what you see are the 
potential buggy commits.

But it's not the nicest of command lines and depends on knowing how
bisection works, so maybe we could make

	git bisect visualize

do this for us?
