Well, end users _don't_ care, since they are supposed to use just a simple
"git xxx".

The advantage with "git-xxx-script" is for git developers: at least yours 
truly does "grep xyz *.c" all the time, and the "grep abc *-script" is 
entirely analogous to that. That's where the "-script" ending comes from: 
it really helps pick out the stuff you can grep from (as opposed to the 
stuff that got compiled and isn't greppable).

Sure, I could have called it ".sh" instead to make it look even more like 
a shell script thing, but I actually think "-script" describes any 
scripting language - shell, perl, you name it..
