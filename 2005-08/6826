Dear diary, on Fri, Aug 05, 2005 at 02:06:13AM CEST, I got a letter
where Petr Baudis <pasky@ucw.cz> told me that...

To clarify, I want to use packs, yes. But plenty of Cogito users are
using HTTP and I want to give them some time to upgrade to the latest
Git which supports pulling packs over HTTP. I'd say at least two to
three weeks or me getting near the top of kernel.org object users,
whichever comes first. :-)
