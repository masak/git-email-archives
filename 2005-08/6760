I ended up looking at wildcards in pathspecs, but wasn't quite ready
enough to pay the price of real wildcards. This limited form is the end
result.

It allows a final '*' in the path matching to indicate that we don't care 
about the "match exact files/subdirectories only" rule.

So while

	git-whatchanged git

will only show the file called "git" (or any changes under a subdirectory
called "git"),

	git-whatchanged git*

will show anything that starts with "git".

Note that this _only_ works at the very end. You can't say

	git-whatchanged git-*-script

even though maybe it would be good if we allowed full wildcards some day.

Btw, I'm not sure this is a wonderful idea. I found it useful for doing

	git-whatchanged -p drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx*

since I was interested in seeign if only that particular driver had had 
changes. But it's hacky and pretty limited, so I throw this patch out more 
as a "maybe others think it is a good idea" thing. 

So Junio, if you feel this is ugly, just drop it, I certainly won't mind.  
As it is you can't even escape the '*', so if you actually only want to
match a filename that literally ends in an asterisk, this makes that
impossible, and will match that file _and_ anything that shares the same
prefix..
