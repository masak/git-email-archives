One thing that Carl's undo saves that is not easily available in
the patch form is the "what is this patch based on" information.
If you had it, you could do a three-way merge instead of patch
application.

You were at A (time flows from left to right) when somebody
(maybe your bright idea) interrupted you.  You take a snapshot
of your tree state D as a pair <A, D>, and rewind the tree to
original commit A's state:

 -->A
     \
      D

Then you do the work that interrupted you, maybe making commits
B and then C:

 -->A-->B-->C
     \
      D

At this point, you would want to restart working on whatever you
were doing, which is the difference between A->D applied on top
of C.

You could keep that information as a patch between A->D and
apply it on top of C to get there, which is your approach if I
am reading you correctly.  Carl does a three-way merge between C
and D using A as the pivot point.
