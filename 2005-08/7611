getopt() is too limited, and getopt_long() is very glibc-specific and thus
inherently evil. And the complexity of doing autoconf or similar is worse
than just doing it by hand.

I've considered doing a small library that could just be contained withing 
the git sources to avoid duplication, but it just hasn't been worth it.

If somebody wants to do it, go wild. The rules are
 - anything that is not expected of "modern unix" is too unportable (glibc 
   is not a realistic expectation, but a lot of GNU tools _are_ realistic)
 - autoconf and its ilk are worse than the disease they are trying to fix
