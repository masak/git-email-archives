Ah, okay. I think "push" and "checkout" don't play that well together;
"push" changes the ref, which "checkout" uses to determine what it expects
for the old contents, and then it's confused.

What you probably actually want is:

cd ../test-git
git pull ../test-git2

which will correctly identify before and after, and remove any files that
were removed.

Alternatively, you could do, at point 1:

cp .git/refs/master .git/refs/deployed
git checkout deployed

Then, after the push and cd:

git checkout master
cp .git/refs/master .git/refs/deployed
git checkout deployed

because checkout does remove files if you switch from a branch with them
(e.g., deployed) to one without them (master, after the push).
