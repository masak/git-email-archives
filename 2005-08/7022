No, you probably missed the earlier thread on this.  It's not a bug,
those are real dependencies which rpm automagically discovers (along
with things like shared library dependencies).  The issue is the
git-send-email-script uses Mail/Sendmail.pm and Email/Valid.pm which
aren't part of standard install.  Your choices are to grab the relevant
packages, do an install with --nodeps (and know that
git-send-email-script will not work), make a subpackage for that script
so it can have its own dependencies, or move that script to elsewhere
so it's not scanned for depenedency info.

thanks,
