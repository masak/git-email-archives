<AOL>. Patches can be useful during the process, but you should (a)
prefer more solid manifestations of the file/tree if possible, and (b)
be extremely strict with them. Any hint that they don't match means
that something is borked.

However, if you're importing from patch-oriented SCMs that tend to
'replay' patch sequences from one branch to the other, asking git to
skip applied patches *could* be a shortcut. Not 100% correctness
guarantee, but if the resulting history makes sense, it can be useful.

The other alternative is to do what I'll start to do soon on the
archimport script: keep a tally of what was merged where according to
the records that the source SCM has.

cheers,
