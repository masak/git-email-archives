OK, you're the second person to ask for that, so I'll see what I can
do about it.  I can think of 3 possible behaviors when you click on
the arrowhead:

1. scroll to bring the other arrowhead on-screen and briefly make it
   larger or something similar to draw attention to it

2. scroll to bring the other arrowhead on-screen and warp the pointer
   to it

3. select the next commit in the indicated direction which is a child
   or parent that the line connects (scroll to make it visible,
   highlight it, show its diff).

Which do you think would be best?

Hmmm, maybe it's apache on ozlabs.org that is under that
misapprehension?

Thanks,
Paul.
