What format-patch does is currently is fine.  If format-patch would
simply notice the case and fail gracefully that would be sufficient to
avoid giving false impressions.

Depending on the quality of the list from git-rev-list --merge-order
I should even be able to achieve what I was attempting, by
running git-diff-tree with an ordered list of revisions and 
two parents on the tree.

Essentially I was attempting an export to quilt operation, which
implies a linearization of the changes.  As I recall a linearization
of the changes is what BK export to CVS was built on.  So that
case may be worth returning to as there are a lot of interesting
cases out there for it.

The other interest tid bit about my experiment was that
git-format-patch-script on 2000 diffs was sluggish, certainly slower
that the time to perform the write operations.  Why it was slow
I don't know but it may be worth looking into.

If you can teach the user how to use bisect, and git.  

If we could get gitweb to perform the bisect it would be helpful,
or possibly when git settles down and everyone can be counted on
to have git on their machine already, bisect would be a help.

Had I been thinking a little more clearly I would have suggested
walking through the daily git snapshots as those are at least
fairly big steps.

For the moment I think the unexpected behavior I found in git 
is more interesting then the problem I was actually trying to solve.
