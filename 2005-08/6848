Um, guys...

If you want to have a dependency on git-core >= 0.99.3 you need to 
actually like, you know, put it on-line as well.  Just did a yum update, 
fails with:

error: Failed dependencies:
         git-core >= 0.99.3 is needed by cogito-0.13-1

But on the git repository the git-core == 0.99.1

might wanna fix that.  (and man is google fast)
