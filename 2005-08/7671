I'm not sure how applicable to this situation stgit really is; I see stgit
as optimized for the case of a patch set which is basically done, where
you want to keep it applicable to the mainline as the mainline advances.

For your application, I'd just have a git branch full of various stuff,
and then generate clean commits by branching mainline, diffing development
against it, cutting the diff down to just what I want to push, and
applying that. Then the clean patch goes into stgit.

I was thinking of this as being the top and bottom commits for a single
tracked patch, not as a whole series. I think patches lower wouldn't be
affected, and patches higher would see this as a rebase.
