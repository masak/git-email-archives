I often do some maybe not that brilliant changes in my tree,
and when I then ask git to reset these I expect git to reset
everything.

After a git-reset HEAD^ I really expect git to have rewinded back till
where I started with no files added whatsoever.

>From the matter of least suprise git should not remember files added,
one have to do that by themself again if needed.
