My proposal is actually to detect when a merge is ambiguous. In order to
determine that, however, you have to evaluate multiple potential outcomes
and see if they are actually different. I'm working on an efficient way to
do that.

Then further work could look into eliminating possibilities when
information about the history excludes them. There were two issues in the
case that Tony hit: it ignored a potential correct outcome for the merge,
and it didn't ignore an outcome which could be demonstrated to be
incorrect. The priority is to resolve the first, but things which improve
the second or help with solutions to the second are worth understanding.
