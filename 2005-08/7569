No comment on this one at this moment until I do my own digging
a bit.

My personal preference is to rewrite parts that are easily
unbashified first before going that route, but I suspect that it
would end up being the best practical solution to simply admit
that we depend on bash, start our scripts with "#!/bin/bash",
and rewrite them "#!/usr/local/bin/bash" upon installation;
modulo that it may be a stupid and ugly workaround.
