It works for me. You _should_ see something like

	#
	# Updated but not checked in:
	#   (will commit)
	#
	#       modified: somedir/somefile
	#
	#
	# Changed but not updated:
	#   (use git-update-cache to mark for commit)
	#
	#	modified: otherdir/anotherfile
	#

which basically means that it will commit "somedir/somefile", but _not_ 
commit "otherdir/anotherfile".

However, one thing to look out for is that if you've marked any files for 
update (with git-update-cache) those will always be committed regardless 
of what arguments you give to "git commit". You can reset the index with 
"git reset" if you decided that you don't want to commit after all.

(For example, if you do a "git commit --all", but decide not to commit 
after all by writing an empty commit message, that will already have 
marked all the files to be committed, so next time, even if you then use 
"git commit somedir", all the files in all the _other_ dirs have already 
been marked for update, so you'll see everything being committed).
