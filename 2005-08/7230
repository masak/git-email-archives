Correct.

Well, you can export them with "git send-email" and you won't be losing 
any comments.

Alternatively, use "git cherry", which helps re-order the commits in your
tree. They'll be _new_ commits, but they'll have the contents moved over. 
Junio, maybe you want to talk about how you move patches from your "pu" 
branch to the real branches.

Well, you'll end up having the same change twice. It happens. Or if you 
just redo your tree as a separate branch, you can reorder things so that 
you don't have them twice at all.

That's correct. Same things apply: you can move a patch over, and create a 
new one with a modified comment, but basically the _old_ commit will be 
immutable.

The good news is that it means that nobody else can change what you said 
or did either.

Oh, sure, that's certainly very possible, and the git cherry stuff even
helps you do it.  Or use "git-apply --check" to just see if a patch
applies and do your own scripts.
