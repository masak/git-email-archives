That's the point I missed, now it's more clear.

If I uderstand correctly you never commit patches from StGIT stack directly
in your base git repository, in this example git HEAD, but you always round 
trip to MAIN. 

Then you don't have two git repository: HEAD and MAIN

Infact there is only one git repository, MAIN, cloned on your box and called HEAD and 
with a StGIT stack added on top.
