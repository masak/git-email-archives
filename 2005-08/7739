Maybe I forgot to mention this: I would also like to have my development
tree split up in a patch stack. The separate patches makes tracking the
mainline a lot easier (conflicts are a lot easier to solve)

But this would assume that once the patch goes into stgit, it won't
change except when the parent gets updated. I think we will still change
the patches quite a bit and simultanious by a couple of people.

ah, ok, I misunderstood that part
