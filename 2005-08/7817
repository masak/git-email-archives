I don't actually think that conflicts between shared heads is a
problem. Given the criss-cross case (we want to merge A and B into M):

 M
 |\
 | \
 A  B
 |\/|
 |/\|
 C  D
 | /
 |/
 E

Lets assume there is a merge conflict if we try to merge C and D
(which are the two shared heads). Then both A and B must resolve this
conflict. If they have done it in the same way we wont get a merge
conflict at M, if they have resolved it differently we will get a
merge conflict. In the first case there is no merge conflict at M, in
the second case the user has to pick which one of the two different
resolutions she wants.

Note that the algorithm will happily write non-clean merge results to
the object database during the "merge shared heads" stage. Hence, when
we are merging C and D "internally" we will _not_ ask the user to
resolve any eventual merge conflicts.

The expensive part is the repeated merging. But as I wrote in my mail
multiple shared heads seems to be pretty uncommon. As far as I can
tell there is no reason for the number of shared heads to increase as
a repository grows larger. However, this do probably depend on usage
patterns.

But it is certainly possible to construct cases with an arbitrary
number of shared heads. In which case the algorithm will be a bit
slow, at least if there are real content merges going on which are
handled by merge(1).

It will be interesting to have a look at the code when you are done.
I find the Git architecture with respect to merging to be quite
nice. A core which handles the simple cases _fast_ and let the more
complicated cases be handled by someone else.
