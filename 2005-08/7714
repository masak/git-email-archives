Well, the patch makes it an _explicit_ assumption, instead of a very 
subtly hidden one from the code-flow. It was the non-obvious hidden 
assumption that caused the bug.

Fair enough. However, there are two kinds of flags: the "revision flags", 
and the "-p" kind of flags.

And the problem was that "git-whatchanged -p" didn't work any more,
because we passed "-p" along to "git-rev-list". Gaah.
