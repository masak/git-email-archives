Dear diary, on Sat, Aug 13, 2005 at 11:09:13AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...
> It was a mistake to use GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
> environment variable to specify what alternate object pools to
> look for missing objects when working with an object database.
> It is not a property of the process running the git commands,
> but a property of the object database that is partial and needs
> other object pools to complete the set of objects it lacks.
> 
> This patch allows you to have $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY/info/alt
> file whose contents is in exactly the same format as the
> environment variable, to let an object database name alternate
> object pools it depends on.

> Signed-off-by: Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>

What about calling it rather info/alternates (or info/alternate)? It
looks better, sounds better, is more namespace-ecological tab-completes
fine and you don't type it that often anyway. :-)
