Thank you for explaining the reasoning, and reworking the patch.  This
does make more sense, and I can see the logic for leaving around the
packs.  Coming from the perspective of the end user, I would probably
want to repack quite a bit more often to take advantage of the size and
speed advantages, while large public repositories will probably want to
repack at much longer periods.  Thanks for seeing both perspectives.  I
like your updated patch.
