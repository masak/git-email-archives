"git branch" just creates the branch, it doesn't actually do anything
else. Use "git checkout <branchname>" to switch to it.

You can do both with "bit checkout -b <branchname>" which both creates the 
branch and switches to it.

(Both "git branch" and "git checkout -b <branchname>" that reate a new
branch take an optional argument which says what point you want the branch
to start at. It defaults to "current state", but you can create a branch
at any point in the history by just explicitly stating the commit name
that you want to start off with as the head of the branch)

Use "gitk --all" to visualize where the different branches are in the 
history, and a plain "git branch" with no arguments to list the branches 
and mark your currently active branch.
