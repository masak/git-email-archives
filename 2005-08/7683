I spoke too fast.  merge-base is not giving you an incorrect
answer.  It just happens that the answer was way suboptimal.

The "[ACPI] re-enable platform-specific hotkey" is what it
chose, and my monkey guessing origin~34 happened to be better
merge base, but the logic used by merge-base is to pick the
latest (from wallclock wise) commit among several candidates,
and by that criteria it did the "right" thing.

In this case, the "right" thing was a wrong decision.  So we
probably should revisit how we choose the "best" merge base
among candidates.  I think "origin~34" which happened to be the
last one output by "git show-branch" was just an accident, not a
good rule to follow, so changing merge-base to use the one that
the other command shows the last would not be a good way to fix
this.

Probably the ideal way would be to give merge-base an option to
spit out all the candidates, and have the script try to see
which ones yield the least number of non-trivial merges.

Linus?
