Well, git-tar-tree has been there since late April - it's actually one of 
those really early commands. I'm pretty sure the RSS feed came later ;)

I use it all the time in doing releases, it's a lot faster than creating a 
tar tree by reading the filesystem (even if you don't have to check things 
out). A hidden pearl.

This is my crappy "release-script":

	[torvalds@g5 ~]$ cat bin/release-script
	#!/bin/sh
	stable="$1"
	last="$2"
	new="$3"
	echo "# git-tag-script v$new"
	echo "git-tar-tree v$new linux-$new | gzip -9 > ../linux-$new.tar.gz"
	echo "git-diff-tree -p v$stable v$new | gzip -9 > ../patch-$new.gz"
	echo "git-rev-list --pretty v$new ^v$last > ../ChangeLog-$new"
	echo "git-rev-list --pretty=short v$new ^v$last | git-shortlog > ../ShortLog"
	echo "git-diff-tree -p v$last v$new | git-apply --stat > ../diffstat-$new"

and when I want to do a new kernel release I literally first tag it, and 
then do

	release-script 2.6.12 2.6.13-rc6 2.6.13-rc7

and check that things look sane, and then just cut-and-paste the commands.

Yeah, it's stupid.
