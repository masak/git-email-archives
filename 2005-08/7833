I've gotten to the point of having all of the entries for a given path
ready to put into the cache at the same, and now I want to convert the
merge functions to take their data directly, rather than in the cache, so
that they can take extra entries for extra ancestors.

Part of threeway_merge, however, wants to search the rest of the cache for
interfering entries in some cases, which would have to happen differently,
because I won't have the cache completely filled out beforehand. I'm
trying to figure out what the comments are talking about, and they seem to
refer to a list of the possible cases. Is that list somewhere convenient?
