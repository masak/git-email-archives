Sorry about that.  I used to have a wrapper to deal with packs
around http-pull before Daniel's pack enhancement, and yanking
it before really checking that enhanced http-pull actually
worked was my fault as well.

I'll push one out with two patches from Daniel today in short
order.  Currently running the final "make test" round.

Wouldn't enhancing ssh-push to generate packs on the fly involve
reinventing send-pack and/or upload-pack?

If send-pack/receive-pack pair for the push side, and/or
fetch&clone-pack/upload-pack pair for the pull side does not
work as well as you would want, then ssh-push/pull pair may
still be a useful tool, at the same time that means send-pack
and upload-pack should be fixed to address the problem you have
with them.  But if that is not the case, then it might be better
to declare that ssh-pull/push pair has outlived its usefulness.

The same thing can be said about local-pull to a lesser degree.
Lesser because people, including Pasky who said so on the list
recently, would like its hard-linking behaviour, and its not
exploding the existing packs, which send-pack and upload-pack
would not give.  So I would rate local-pull higher than
ssh-push/pull on the priority scale if I were doing them.
