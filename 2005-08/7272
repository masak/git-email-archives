It is my own home-grown Porcelain that creates the symlinks.  I've
thrown together a python programme to track a nested collection of
projects.  My own programming efforts rarely exceed two or three files
per project, and don't justify there own .git/objects repository.
Still, a few projects do benefit from having their own commit history,
while the rest are tracked as one big outermost superproject of
unrelated stuff.

Whether or not its useful??  Hmmm.  Debatable.

I've only written a commit tool.  All the other git and cogito tools I
invoke from the outermost directory like so 

$git-cat-file commit per/Minesweeper/master

Symlinking still works here as expected.  The per directory is just
there so I don't stomp on the outermost namespace, the Minesweeper is a
symlink to the nested project's refs directory.  Symlinking seems the
natural way to do this as they only need updating when I move
subdirectories around.

P.S. $echo new-id > .git/per/Minesweeper/master is safe here --- this is
the actual behaviour I want.
