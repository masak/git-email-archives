Doesn't matter if the merge is after a git checkout -f
or not.  I was just pointing out that it also fails
if there are no plain files checked out.

rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/to-akpm.git

fails when merged into latest linus, or when latest linus
is merged into it.

I suspect some artifact of my patches being based on
one of several branches rooted at 2.6.12 is the issue,
and that in switching between latest 2.6.13 and stable
2.6.12 branches, some state has bled through that
now confuses the heck out of resolve.

thanks,
