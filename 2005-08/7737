Actually I can't take credit here. This was a case of the "many-eyes" of
open source working at its finest ... someone e-mailed me and told me
that I should have backed out the old patch before applying the new one.
While typing the e-mail to say that I already had in the release branch,
I found the problem that it had been "lost" in the merge into the test branch.

But this is a good reminder that merging is not a precise science, and
there is more than one plausible merge in many situations ... and while
GIT will pick the one that you want far more often than not, there is
the possibility that it will surprise you.  Maybe there should be a note
to this effect in the tutorial.  Git is not magic, nor is it imbued with
DWIM technology.
