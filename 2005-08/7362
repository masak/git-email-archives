I'll look at that in a bit. I already picked up a few of the patches
mentioned on the list.

I'm afraid not. However I think I've found a problem when I tried
running cvsps on its own to generate the patchset. It seems that
REV_STR_MAX (cvsps-2.1/cvsps_types.h) wasn't big enough to contain some
of our version strings.

This will be a feature of our development process which means all
changes are based of branches, some of which branch multiple times and
live for a long time before code is merged into the mainline. I don't
know if any open source projects use CVS in such a way.

My import seems to be getting a lot further now. I now just need to
clean out the corrupted files that are breaking cvs log.
