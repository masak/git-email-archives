Just do

	git checkout branch-name

to switch between them.

One thing that "git cvsimport" does not know to do is to show when a
branch was merged back into the HEAD. That would be a very interesting
thing to see, but I don't think there's any way to get that information
out of CVS (so you'd have to basically make an educated guess by looking
at the changes).

So in a cvsimport, you'll never see a merge back to the head, even if one 
technically took place.

Confusion of naming.

branches and heads are the same thing in git. However, largely due to 
historical reasons, I encouraged "one tree pre branch", and then you had 
"external branches" which were totally separate repositories.

Now, we're stuck with both the "internal branches" (heads) and "external
branches" (other repositories) _both_ being confusingly called "branch", 
and then to make it more confusing, sometimes you'll see people say 
"head" to make clear that it's a branch internal to one repo.

They are "proper branches", and sorry about the confusion. A head is a 
branch.
