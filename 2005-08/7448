Sorry if the answer is silly, but I still don't know well StGIT .

What you describe it's an asymmetrical or one way scenario, new code 
goes always from HEAD to MAIN. But how is the workflow if:

1) There is more then one contributor feeding MAIN and you need to update 
the StGIT patch stack from MAIN.

2) You made something terribly wrong with HEAD (I don't know what can be 
'terribly wrong') and you need to recreate a clean base from MAIN.

In this cases, if I understand correctly, you need to clone a new StGIT archive from 
MAIN and push the interesting stuff from old/broken HEAD.

Or you can always merge back pulling from MAIN as in case of two pure git archives?


Thanks
Marco
