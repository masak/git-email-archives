Unless they want to write something that doesn't fit in ASCII, as
discussed in another thread here.

But maybe you are only talking about MIME attachments, and not about
MIME content encodings?  We probably need to separate the two.

Note that I'm not really talking about your patch handling for Linux;
you are free to disallow my name in Linux patches if you want to.  But
I'd like to see a way to get rid of that limitation for other uses of
git.
