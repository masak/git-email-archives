Yes. Use the "--inetd" flag, and open port 9418 instead.

Yes.

The default one is 9418, although you can use "--port=xxx" to set it to
something else. Obviously, if you put it at some other port, you either
need to re-compile the client side with the new port number (it's
DEFAULT_GIT_PORT in cache.h) or need to use

	git://my.domain.com:<port>/path/to/repository

> c) Is git-daemon multithreaded (ie do I use nowait in inetd.conf)?

Yup, it's entirely safe to run tons of them concurrently.

You can also run the git deamon without inetd, and it will do it's own 
serving. That normally limits it to 25 connections at a time.

Yes. The first thing the git-deamon will do is to chdir to the argument 
(and add ".git" to the end if it can't find the exact path), and then look 
up a file called "git-daemon-export-ok". If that file does not exist, it 
will exit.

This means, btw, that it will _not_ export any random git directory by 
default, much less anything else. You literally have to mark your git 
directories for export explicitly by doing a "touch git-daemon-export-ok" 
in the .git directory.

See "daemon.c: upload()" for some of the details.

Yes. That's the normal way to do it. The anonymous "git://" protocol can 
only do reads (adn it is entirely anonymous). For pushes, you _have_ to 
use ssh, either through

	git push my.domain.com:/path/to/repository

or

	git push ssh://my.domain.com/path/to/repository

(and you can obviously shorthand the format by putting it into your 
.git/remotes/ files, so that you can do things like "git push public".)

There shouldn't be any other gotchas. But no, you can't _quite_ use 
git-receive-pack as the login shell. Why? Because if you have it as your 
login shell, it will get the wrong arguments: it will get:

	0: git-receive-pack
	1: -c
	2: git-receive-pack '/path/to/repository'

and you'd need to have some ultra-simple shell that took this, verified
the proper arguments, and turned it into an

	execvp(git-receive-pack, /path/to/repository, NULL);

But yes, you _should_ be able to do it with that ultra-simplistic login 
shell. Probably just a 5-liner main() function or something.
