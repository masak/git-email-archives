Dear diary, on Sat, Jul 30, 2005 at 04:11:48AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...
> By the way, do people mind my posting my own patches to the

Browsing the "pu" branch may be bothersome and you won't ensure that the
related discussion stays in a single thread, and posting the patches
here makes them generally more visible, so I think it's a good idea to
keep doing so.

Cogito (and Git itself as well, I guess) does not handle those
"volatile" branches well at all - following them is difficult since
Cogito will think that you did some local commits and want to do a tree
merge. Would anyone consider doing

	if ref(updatebranch) == ref(master) then
		merge: always_fastforward
	else
		merge: perhaps_treemerge

a Bad Thing (tm)? It seems to me that it should do the right thing and
never get it wrong.
