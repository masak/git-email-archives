IIRC, git-local-pull still doesn't work for a packed source repository, 
because it doesn't include the possibility of copying a pack (or 
extracting an object) if the requested object is in a pack.

I can probably fix it if anyone cares, but it's not something I use 
personally, so I don't know if it's worthwhile. It should probably be 
removed if we don't fix it, since it will fail on any popular repository 
at this point.
