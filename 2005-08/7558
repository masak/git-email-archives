I would suggest against a person owning a "merge and publish". Instead, 
just have a public repo that everybody involved to can push to - _they_ 
will need to merge before they push (since a push won't accept a unrelated 
parent), but that way anybody can export their changes at any time, 
exactly like with a central CVS repository.

No, just do

	git checkout <headname>

If you use "git checkout" to switch branches, it will do that testing for 
you. You can still _force_ a head switch with "git checkout -f".

Oh, and if a file was dirty that is the same in both heads, the 
"dirtyness" follows you into the new head. If that isn't what you want, 
then you need to add some logic like

	if [ "$(git-diff-files)" != "" ]; then
		echo "Current branch not clean" >&2
		exit 1
	fi
	git checkout "$@"

or something.
