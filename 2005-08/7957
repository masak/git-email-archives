This was my initial StGIT implementation (up to version 0.3), only that
there was no freeze command. Since I want an StGIT tree to be clean to
the outside world, I wouldn't keep multiple parents for the visible top
of a patch.

As I understand from Junio's and Linus' e-mails (on the 23rd of August),
there might be problems with merging the HEAD of an StGIT-managed tree
if the above method is accessible via HEAD.

A merge occurs every time a patch is rebased. Anyway, having the bottoms
in the graph (which is the main idea of StGIT) together with the old-top
(or frozen state) parents make the graph pretty complicated.
