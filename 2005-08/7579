I am planning my way through switching over to using git (as opposed to 
subversion - via svnserve) to publish some stuff.

At the moment I leave a hole in my firewall for port 3690 and svnserve is run 
as a daemon from inetd.  I use svnserve's own user/realm management to limit 
the repositories I make public.

If I switch over to git, I assume I run git-daemon from inetd.

BUT

a) Is this what the git://my.domain.com/path/to/repository url refers to 
(neither get-pull-script nor git-fetch-script man pages actually say what 
this form means) ?

b) I can't find any mention in the documentation of what the default port 
should be. What is it?

c) Is git-daemon multithreaded (ie do I use nowait in inetd.conf)?

d) Is it possible to ensure that external accesses can't access anywhere in my 
filesystem? 

e) If I put my public key in ~git/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server, I can 
act as user git on the server via ssh.  Does git push support this?  

f) If I can do e), then perhaps [need to read the docs a bit harder] I can set 
up my user git on the machine to use git-receive-pack as its login shell.  
Will this work? - the tutorial talks about needing .bashrc to set up the 
$PATH environment, but are there any other hidden gotchas?
