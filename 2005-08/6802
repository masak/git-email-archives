Dear diary, on Wed, Aug 03, 2005 at 08:20:01AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

I think it's fine. EINTR means it got a signal while waiting, it might
be worthwhile checking by strace what signal it actually was - one thing
coming on my mind is SIGPIPE or so, but I barely saw the code. Anyway,
just sticking your hand in sand if you see this is probably fine.
