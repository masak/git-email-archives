Dear diary, on Sun, Jul 31, 2005 at 02:42:28PM CEST, I got a letter
where Sergey Vlasov <vsu@altlinux.ru> told me that...
> Hello!

Hi,

> Today's pull from rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/cogito.git
> downloaded more than 10 MB.  It seems that the cogito.git repository
> currently contains all objects in unpacked form, even though most of
> that objects are already in pack files.
> 
> Also there are two mysterious files:

> objects/base.idx
> objects/base.pack
> 
> Could this be fixed?

yes, sorry about this. Packs got there through rsyncs all the way from
git-core, and my immediate naive git-unpack-objects didn't actually do
anything since all the objects were, well, in
.git/objects/pack/thatpackfile. Obviously, this behaviour is reasonable
when you think about it, but rather pitfallous, I would say. At least
documenting it might be worthwhile.

BTW, if you pull now, be prepared to get git-core from elsewhere, since
it will disappear from under your hands as I just unbundled it from
Cogito. ;-)
