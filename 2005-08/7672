Ok, the following is what I came up with based on your response.  This
is .git/hooks/update.  It mostly works in my situation.  See below for
my discussion on what didn't work.

#!/bin/sh

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

# cd to the root of the project directory (assume one dir up from GIT_DIR)
cd $GIT_DIR/..
unset GIT_DIR

if expr "$2" : '0*$' >/dev/null; then
    git-read-tree --reset $3 &&
        git-checkout-cache -q -f -u -a
else
    git-read-tree -m -u $2 $3
fi

exit 0

# --- snip ---

The thing that this doesn't do is remove empty directories when the last
file is deleted.  I once expressed the opinion in a previous thread that
directories should be added and removed explicitly in git.  (Thus
allowing an empty directory to be added).  If this were to happen then
this case would get handled correctly.  However, if git stays with the
status quo then I think that git-read-tree -u should be changed to
remove the empty directory.  This would make it consistent.

What do you think?  Ideas?

Carl
