If each developer has a trivial web server, they can put their output 
there, and everyone else can pull from it, because it only needs to serve 
static files out of a directory structure that the programs create 
regularly. Of course, this is only strictly different from a public repo 
in that you don't advertize it beyond the other developers. But it's a 
within-system equivalent to posting a link to a web-hosted patch set, 
which people sometimes do to pass things around.

If you contribe the git support to gforge, presumably similar hosting 
sites will pick it up before too long.
