Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  This does not happen for me.

I tried a simple test with git v0.99.4...

cd
mkdir test-git && cd test-git/
echo testing | cg-init
echo contents > file
git-add-script file
git-commit-script -m 'testing'
cd ..
cg-clone test-git/.git/ test-git2
cd test-git2
cg-rm file
git-commit-script -m 'testing'
ls
cg-push
cd ../test-git
git-checkout-script
ls
git-status-script

At this point, I want 'file' to be gone.  It is, however, still there.
That is the situation that my code was meant to handle.  Maybe you were
thinking of something different?  Maybe there is new code since 0.99.4?

Now, I think it would be wrong for git-checkout-script to actually
remove files unless an option were given to do so.  So, the behavior
that I observe is correct in my opinion.  I'm looking for a way to find
out what files should be deleted if that is desired.

Thanks,
Carl
