It looks like stage 2 is currently special as the stage that's similar to
the index/HEAD/working tree. However, I don't see any problem with <n>
entries in stage 3, except that, if you have a non-maximal number of them
for some reason, it'll be impossible to determine which came from which
tree.

That's actually the problem I was working on.

I'd be afraid of confusing everything by removing the uniqueness
invariant, although I guess not too much does anything with entries in
stages other than 0. I probably just don't find the index as intuitive as
you do and as the struct tree representation.

I'm working on arranging the code to look at each path in sequence, with
the input trees as the inner loop, rather than with the loops in the other
order; using parse_tree to parse the objects instead of read_tree; and
doing trivial merges before putting things in the cache, rather than
after. I'd been thinking that this would avoid a limit on the number of
stages, since I hadn't considered whether multiple entries for the same
path and stage could be allowed.

I still think that my order is likely to be easier to understand and
involve read-tree relying less on tricky properties of the data
structures, but I'll have to get it done before I can say that for sure.
