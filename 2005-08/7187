Dear diary, on Sat, Aug 13, 2005 at 04:45:32PM CEST, I got a letter
where Kenneth Johansson <ken@canit.se> told me that...

Yes, I know about this problem and something should be done about it.
The possible approaches:

* Check for /^<<<<<<</ lines (that's what CVS does)
	+: User does not need to take an explicit action to indicate
	   resolved conflict.
	-: False positives if the file with conflict contains that
	   string naturally.

* Make auxiliary files and check for their existence (what SVN does)
	+: User can use the auxiliary files (usually containing the
	   to-be-merged revisions) for better conflict resolution,
	   or run some own merging tool on it later.
	-: Extremely rare false positives.
	-: User needs to explicitly get rid of the files to get rid
	   of the conflict.

* Keep the conflict recorded in index
	+: No junk in working directory, cg-status should start working
	   right away.
	-: Unknown caveats wrt. index files containing conflicts...?
	-: User needs to explicitly run cg-resolve or something to
	   get rid of the conflict.

Ideas? Opinions?
