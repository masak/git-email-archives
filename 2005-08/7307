I like those prefetch() and process() code in pull.c very much.

I have been wondering if increasing parallelism more by
prefetching beyond the immediate parents of the current commit,
in "if (get_history)" part of process_commit().  Maybe it is not
worth it because doing a commit, its associated tree(s) and its
parents would already give us enough parallelism already.

That is a great news.  Thank you for doing this; looking forward
to see it, but no rush.  Enjoy your new monitor.
