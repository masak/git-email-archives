Hmmm. That repo is in sync, but there are no guarantees that they will
travel together to a different repo. In fact, the push/pull
infrastructure wants to push/pull one head at a time.

And if they are not in sync, I have no way of knowing. Hmpf. I lie:
the arch metadata could keep track of what it expects the last head
commits to be, and complain bitterly if something smells rotten.

let me think about it ;)
