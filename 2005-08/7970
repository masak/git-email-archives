I'll send a replacement with the settings correct.

Ah, it looks like a recent version changed the default behavior to do the 
right thing, and inverted the sense of the configuration option. (Either 
that or Gentoo did it.) So you need to set the 
"no-strip-whitespace-before-send" option, unless the option you have is 
"strip-whitespace-before-send", in which case you should avoid checking 
it.

I don't actually have things set up for preparing patches from work, 
although I can resend the patches I prepared earlier.
