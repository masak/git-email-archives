Is this used at commit time, and stored somewhere (doesn't seem to be)
or do you select older patches from the destination branch at merge
time?

If you only compare patches since the last merge, patches that were
merged but somehow unreported will fall into a black hole and cause a
conflict going forward anyway. Hmm.  That seems to be a problem I
won't be able to avoid if merges happen out-of-order.

I'll try and work out how it's being used during the merge
(pointers/hints welcome) and see if I can do something smart w it.
Thanks!

cheers,


martin
