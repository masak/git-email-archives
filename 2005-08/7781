Yup, though actually replaying the tree to compute the hashes is
something I just _won't_ do ;)

My plan doesn't include git->arch support... yet...

Now I like that interesting idea. It doesn't solve all my problems,
but is a reasonable mapping point. Will probably do it.

I won't get into _that_ flamewar ;)

My plan for merges is to detect when two branches up until what point
branches are fully merged, and mark that in git -- because that is
what git considers a merge. The rest will be known to the importer,
but nothing else.
