Sorry, I wrote this part carelessly: "If I had checked out and
compiled those intermediate versions from scratch..."

I meant to emphasize the 'from scratch'.  I did check out and compile
the versions, but I didn't compile from scratch. i.e. I just took
whatever directory tree I got after

  git bisect good
or
  git bisect bad

and then did 'make -j 4'.  Perhaps I should have done

  make clean 
  <restore .config>
  make -j 4

to be really sure that every file that needed recompilation got
recompiled.
