The example was of course about the simpliest thing i thought of.

I would find that variable (GIT_SSH) usefull, and actually it does no
harm, because you already have GIT_SSH_PULL & PUSH variables, for the
same purpose (to define different name).

Actually I think there is at least one case, when helper script is useful.
I mean, how would you setup different identities for more user accounts on =
the
same server (it doesn't happen often, but..)?

Best regards
