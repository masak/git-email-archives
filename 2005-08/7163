Nope, you're not missing anything, except that you shouldn't do that.

"git-ls-files" is very nice for things like

	git-ls-files | xargs grep ....

but your example is not one of them. Not without options, and not _with_
strange options.

Your example is an example of just not doing it the right way.

If you really want a temporary tree, what you do is something like

	git-checkout-cache --prefix=tmp-dir/ -f -a

and when you're done, you just do

	rm -rf tmp-dir

and you're done.

NOTE NOTE NOTE! In the above, the order of the parameters is really really 
important! "-a" takes effect when it is seen, so it needs to be last. 
Also, the "--prefix" thing really _really_ needs the slash at the end, 
because it's literally used to prefix the pathname.

HOWEVER, if all you want to do is just a tar-file, then there's a better 
solution. It's called

	snap=git-snapshot-$(date +"%Y%m%d")
	git-tar-tree HEAD $snap | gzip -9 > $snap.tar.gz

which is even easier, and a hell of a lot more efficient.

Git actually has a _lot_ of nifty tools. I didn't realize that people 
didn't know about such basic stuff as "git-tar-tree" and "git-ls-files".
