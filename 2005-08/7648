That's true but Jan's proposal is to choose which commits to preserve
in the history via a 'freeze' command. That's a bit difficult to
implement in a clean way since the patches are floating on top of the
stack base and they change every time the base changes. It is possible
that a previous frozen state might no longer apply on top of a new
base.

What's the definition of a parent in GIT terms? What are the
restriction for a commit object to be a parent? Can a parent be an
arbitrarily chosen commit?

That's what I've been thinking. StGIT currently only implements the
external view.

An StGIT patch is a represented by a top and bottom commit
objects. The bottom one is the same as the parent of the top
commit. The patch is the diff between the top's tree id and the
bottom's tree id.

Jan's proposal is to allow a freeze command to save the current top
hash and later be used as a second parent for the newly generated
top. The problem I see with this approach is that (even for the
internal view you described) the newly generated top will have two
parents, new-bottom and old-top, but only the diff between new-top and
new-bottom is meaningful. The diff between new-top and old-top (as a
parent-child relation) wouldn't contain anything relevant to the patch
but all the new changes to the base of the stack.

Is the above an acceptable usage of the GIT DAG structure?

StGIT does this currently. The old commit is no longer available and
can be pruned (I still need to save the commits corresponding to the
unpushed patches since prune would remove those as well).

Since you proposed this, my above usage of the DAG structure would be
fine then.

That's another idea to think about.

P.S. I'll be away until next week and not able to follow-up the
discussions.
