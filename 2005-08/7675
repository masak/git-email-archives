So I have another anomaly in my GIT tree.  A patch to
back out a bogus change to arch/ia64/hp/sim/boot/bootloader.c
in my release branch at commit

 62d75f3753647656323b0365faa43fc1a8f7be97

appears to have been lost when I merged the release branch to
the test branch at commit

 0c3e091838f02c537ccab3b6e8180091080f7df2

So now this file still has this:

/* SSC_WAIT_COMPLETION appears to want this large alignment.  gcc < 4
* seems to give it by default, however gcc > 4 is smarter and may
* not.
*/
struct disk_stat {
	int fd;
	unsigned count;
} __attribute__ ((aligned (16)));

in the test branch, when I think the comment and __attribute__
should have been backout out.
