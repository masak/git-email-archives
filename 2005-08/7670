Meaning you did not have any file in the working tree?  It seems
to me that what is happenning is the resolve is trying to merge
the head of your tree and from-linus, but at the same time it
notices that you removed those files from your working tree and
thinks that is what you would want to do.

I could get to 81065e2f415af6... commit (Linus tip at this
moment), so if you can tell me where to snarf the other commit
(702c7e76....) that would help me diagnose the problem a lot.

Thanks.
