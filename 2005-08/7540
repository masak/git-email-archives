Nope.

Git just doesn't deal in patches. There's never any patch rejects: there 
are just two source files that get merged.

The ".orig" and ".rej" things are signs of patch-based systems. 

I'm sure you could fake it, but I'm also sure that there's an emacs mode 
for the "merge" style diffs. It is, after all, what CVS and RCS have used, 
so I'd expect that there be tons of support for making it look nice and 
help merges.
