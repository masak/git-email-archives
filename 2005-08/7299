I should be able to get http-pull down to the neighborhood of 
(current) ssh-pull; http-pull is that slow (when the source repository 
isn't packed) because it's entirely sequential, rather than overlapping 
requests like ssh-pull now does.

I should also be able to get ssh-pull down to the area of clone-pack, but 
that's lower-priority, since there's clone-pack.

(I've written an untested patch for local-pull, which I'll be testing, 
cleaning, and submitting tonight, assuming my newly-arrived monitor 
actually works)

I've noticed that ssh connections don't actually disconnect at the end 
with recent versions of ssh sometimes. In my experience, this occasionally 
happens with git, but always happens with scp, suggesting that it's an ssh 
bug of some sort; I've also only noticed this with openssh 3.9_p1 with 
some of Gentoo's -r2 patches.
