The topmost couple of commits in the "master" branch made from
your patches are incorrectly attributed to me.

What happened was that I stumbled upon a merge conflict during
git-rebase, and ended up hand committing these two without
carrying the authorship information forward from the original
commits.  This usually does not happen because I always use JIT
tools for rebasing, but this time I was trying to stay within
the set of core GIT barebone Porcelain.

I apologize for the screwup.
