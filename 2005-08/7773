I don't think this buys you anything, because then the tag needs to be
accessible from something, which is the same problem you were trying to
solve for the commit.

If you want to go that way, you could add a new field to commits with
minimal effort: you just need to parse it in commit.c, generate it in
git-commit-tree (with an option), and pull it in pull.c, and everything
should work as far as making the git portion follow the metadata around.
