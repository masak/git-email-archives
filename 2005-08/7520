Yes I had a failed merge ... I thought that I had cleaned up from it, but
clearly I hadn't.  Bother.

I guess I have a bit of tree maintenance to do ... But I think that it
should be easy ... I can just step "test" back to before I merged in
the Alex patch.  Redo the Alex patch properly.  Then re-merge all the
branches that happened after this.  Followed by crossing my fingers and
running "git prune".

Maybe I'll try all that in a *copy" of my GIT tree first!
