The simplest way of cleaning up after a failed merge is just a simple "git
reset", which will also tell you if you need to perhaps clean up
afterwards (equally easily done with "git checkout -f" if you just want to 
blow all the changes away.

Yup. Think of it as a good exercise in git ;)

Btw, it's a shame that git has all these "git rebase" etc helper scripts, 
which rebase whole series of patches, but the simple "git re-do" which 
basically ends up being a

	git-diff-tree -p $old | git-apply --index &&
		git commit --reedit=$old

doesn't have a nice helper script.

Anyway, the easiest approach may be to just do

	git branch new-test-branch <good-point>
	git format-patch -o patchdir --mbox <good-point>
	git checkout new-test-branch
	.. edit the individual patches in patchdir/* to taste ..
	cat git-applymbox patchdir/* | git-applymbox

or similar.
