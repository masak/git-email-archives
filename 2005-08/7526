Ahh, ok, fair enough. git-rev-list won't give you that. 

And yes, the general rule is that anything under .git/refs/ is potentially 
a reference. If it's under "heads/" or "tags/" it's a branch/tag, and then 
the prefix "heads/" or "tags/" shouldn't be part of the name - you already 
show the difference with colors. Anything else is unusual, but bisection 
puts refs in the ".git/refs/bisect" directory for example, and if gitk 
were to show those, it should probably show them in yet another color, and 
_with_ the "bisect/" prefix..
