  Hello,

  as I promised some time ago, I finally put together a simple GIT
homepage proposal now available at:

	http://git.or.cz/

  Basically, I took r3 of Ryan Anderson's synopsis, pruned and rewrote
it a bit, added some hypertext and tried to very briefly cover the
porcelain as well. Please tell me what you think, and if you happen to
be author of some porcelain, already mentioned or not, feel encouraged
to send me updates to your description (which should stay brief, though)
etc. And if you don't author any porcelain, send me updates anyway. :-)

  If you like it, it's only up to Junio to decide how official to make
it and possibly/probably take over its maintenance (or designate someone
more suitable than me to do that).

  Thanks,

--

If you want the holes in your knowledge showing up try teaching
someone.  -- Alan Cox
