git-whatchanged internally uses git-rev-list which skips merge
commits.  You need '-m' to cause it not to.

    $ git-whatchanged -m -p linus..test | diffstat -p1

would still not _match_ "git-diff-tree -p linus test | diffstat
-p1" output because conflict-resolving merges inevitably causes
the same file to be touched twice (hence diffstat shows patches
for the same fime twice, adding up the count of the changes), so
in practice, my "use -m if you want to see merges" advice would
not be much useful if you want to _count_ lines using diffstat.

For example, one of the files you had trouble with are touched
by the following commits; only the last one is a non-merge and
that is what you get when you do not give -m to whatchanged:

$ git-whatchanged -m --pretty=oneline test ^linus \
