It would be surely better, but I need to import also the original subject and
description. I can use git-diff-tree --pretty -p for the patch creation, but this
format is not compatible with git-apply* scripts, and the git command git-apply does
not import subject + description info.

Of course I can feed proper subject and description to git-commit but I would like 
to find something less intrusive as possible, ie. one command for patch export, one 
command for patch import.

Thanks
Marco
