I would not have much problem accepting a patch for that; it
would make things safer when a symlink points to a real file
that is outside .git/refs/ that holds a pointer to a valid
object.

Having said that, I would first like to know why you have a
symlink there, and the real file pointed by it outside .git/refs
hierarchy.  The core GIT tools do not create such symlinks, so
either you are creating one by hand, or your Porcelain is
creating one for you for whatever reason.  I would like to know
a use case or two to illustrate why there are symlinks pointing
at real files outside .git/refs/ hierarchy, and how that
arrangement is useful.
