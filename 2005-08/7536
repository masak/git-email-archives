In the section 'Emulating CVS behaviour', where the team setup is
described with a team 'merger'. What is not clear is how to deal with
project-wide branches. Should they be created in the master repo, and
everyone clone a new repo from it?

With a team of 10 people, and perhaps 4 or 5 branches, the setup to
pull stuff back seems messy.

And yet another question: the teammember who is pulling must 'switch'
the merging repo to the right branch, pull from the corresponding
remote repos of each teammember, and push to the public view of the
repo. Is that right?

cheers,


martin
