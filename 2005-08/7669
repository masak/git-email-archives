You could have the remote repository be something like
"~/git/website.git", and have a hook which does: "cd ~/www; git pull
~/git/website.git/". That is, have three things: the directory where you
work on stuff, the central storage location, and the area that the web
server serves, and have the storage location automatically update the web
server area. That's what I do with my website section that's still in CVS,
and the general concept is good (and means that the "real" repository
isn't somewhere the web server is poking around).

If you have "deployed" checked out, and you push to "master" in the same
repository, having the hook do "git resolve deployed master auto-update"
should work.
