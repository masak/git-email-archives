I used to do this with CVS too.  For you and me, people who are patch
savy veterans, this is great!  However, as easy as it is I knew very few
other developers who even thought about doing it.  In the real world,
many people see a huge difference between:

git diff-cache > $patchfile
cat $patchfile | patch -R -p1
do work
cat $patchfile | patch -p1

AND

git undo
do work
git redo

The first one simply never happens with most developers.  Most don't
really think of doing something outside the tool.  The second option
will likely get used.  Plus, I know at least one person here who is very
good with patches and working outside the tool and still would love to
have the second approach available.

Is there something wrong with having flexibility?  It seems most of the
criticism of this feature is that there is already a way to accomplish
what I want to do.  Tools that can't be used flexibly are not tools that
I like to use.  Heck, I'm on UNIX aren't I?

Oops, sorry for the rant.  I'm really not in a bad mood... really.  I
hope it didn't sound like that :-).  Oh, and I didn't mean to suggest
that git is not flexible in other regards.  I think its great!  Moving
along...

I can simulate git manually too with just a few more commands.  Where's
the cutoff?

Not having to manually manage a set of patches may seem small but it
reduces a barrier that may otherwise be just high enough to hurt
productivity in certain situations.

Thanks for your comments.
