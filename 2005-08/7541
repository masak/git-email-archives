Just make them another branch in the master repo. Whether people will 
clone a whole new repo for it, or have just one repo and switch between 
local branches in their own local (single) repo is their personal choice. 
Some people may well prefer to have all different branches checked out in 
different places (ie have one repository per branch) others may prefer to 
work with one repository and just switch.

.. yes. Or alternatively, just keep the repo at that branch (and if such a 
person works on multiple branches, he/she can thus just keep multiple 
repos).
