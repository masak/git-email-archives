Dear diary, on Sat, Aug 13, 2005 at 07:05:11AM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

To put my two cents too, Cogito has cg-export for this:

	cg-export tmp-dir

to export to a temporary directory and

	cg-export git-snapshot.tar.gz

to export to a gzipped tarball (it can also do .tar, .tgz and .tar.bz2).
