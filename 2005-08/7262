I was somewhat thinking it should go in the main directory, and be a
useful introduction to the project for people.... but it's not really
aimed at that very well, now that I think about it.

To be fair, it's not really aimed well at being documentation for people
that already have git, either.  I've been writing it with the idea of
"something to send to LWN when 1.0 happens so they can post it mostly
verbatim."

I guess this means, "I dunno, either place works for me."
