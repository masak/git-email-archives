  Hi,

  if you are following Cogito development closely, please note that
pulling over HTTP and SSH was broken by a late Cogito commit (74b4f7).
This also means that you won't be able to pull the fix (which I just
committed and might take a short while to mirror out) if you pull Cogito
over HTTP.

  cg-pull and cg-update will print the new commit ID on stdout, like:

	Tree change:
	ce471851ee8b6147ac57b211d9d76c3e4d625598:75d9f4a22abefd561147f88be9b7eb81af420f1b

  The second ID (75d9f4a22abefd561147f88be9b7eb81af420f1b) is the new
commit - but it won't get saved and therefore merged. You need to do
that manually; e.g. if the stock Cogito is the origin branch (the usual
setup), do this:

	echo 75d9f4a22abefd561147f88be9b7eb81af420f1b >.git/refs/heads/origin

  Then run cg-merge or rerun cg-update.

  Sorry for any inconvenience,
