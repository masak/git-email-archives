Is FETCH_HEAD going to be preserved by the git-fetch-script operation?
It should be, unless, git-pull-script removes it or it is changed to
do the fetch as well.

In a repository managed with StGIT (i.e. updated with 'stg pull'), the
base of the stack is always the same with FETCH_HEAD and StGIT uses
this file. I also find it quite useful for:

  gitk ORIG_HEAD..FETCH_HEAD

to only see the remote commits since the local StGIT patches are
always seen as commits on top of the FETCH_HEAD. It's also useful for
people using 'git rebase'.
