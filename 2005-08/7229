You can keep most of the metadata you want with "git format-patch".

Extract the changes you need, mail them off.

When you later merge things back together, it should be a trivial merge,
hopefully.

No, a commit is immutable.  You can use "git format-patch" to rebase things if
you need.  I prefer to use "git format-patch --mbox", edit what I need
to, then use git-applymbox to rebase it all against a clean tree.

Not sure on this one - in this case, it almost sounds like you want the
feature set of StGit, and/or quilt.  (If "quilt push" succeeds, clearly
it still merges cleanly.)
