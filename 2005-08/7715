Actually, it was a shared commit
(4aec0fb12267718c750475f3404337ad13caa8f5), which was (an ancestor of) a
candidate merge point, but wasn't the one selected. Since a different one
was chosen, it looked to the 3-way merge like a shared patch (since it
ignores the untaken parent in the merges in the history).

This should be fixable, but it'll require more cleverness in read-tree.
