Well, that too, but I did mention doing the same thing for stage 1, which 
is the "multiple merge bases" case. 

It all boils down to the same thing: we want to read in multiple trees, 
and then do merges one file at a time based on the result (and the fact 
that we can have multiple entries for files in the different stages 
essentially just complicates "git-merge-one-file").

Daniel pointed out that there is a real reason for stage 2 - it's used as 
a special case for "matches current index". Apart from that, it's the same 
as stage 3.

Stage 3 is the one we can duplicate freely. There's can be only one branch
that is special in that it matches the current index, so expanding stage 3 
from one to many is clearly something where all the different trees are on 
equal footing.

Same goes for stage 1 - all merge bases are conceptually equally valid, 
and thus there is no reason to consider any "ordering" between them, and 
you can merge any number of trees into stage 1.

So stage 0 and stage 2 are special in that they inherently have "one
special tree" that they correspond to.
