Ok, goodie. It works fine in my environment, with most merges showing up 
as not interesting. But a merge like

	3e0777b8fa96f7073ed5d13d3bc1d573b766bef9

shows an example of where there was actually both real content merges, and 
some real clashes.

However, most of the content merges were trivial, and they often hide the 
real clashes. For example, if you click on that merge, a _lot_ of it looks 
like it might be clashes, even though most of it was auto-merged. This is 
not really a problem, but I get the feeling that it could be improved 
somehow - maybe a button that hides the parts that don't have clashes?

To get the alternate output, maybe something like:
 - run "merge" on the original/parent1/parent2 (the same way the
   git-merge-one-file-script does)
 - anything that merged fine is in black (regardless of which parent it 
   came from), and then mark the merge rejects are in red/blue depending 
   on parent?

I don't know how doable that would be.
