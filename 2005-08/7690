One issue is later merges.

If you have incorrect parent information, trying to do a merge may prove
impossible and/or ignore changes from the "already merged" stream. By
marking another head as a parent, you basically say "I have merged
_everything_ leading up to that other head", and if you have only actually
done a partial merge (and gotten just a part of the changes, ignoring the
others), you'll have to notice that yourself, and forward-port the rest by
hand.

For stgit, this probably doesn't matter.
