Regarding the update hook:
In this script, it would be nice to be able to distinguish rebasing/forced 
setting of a head from a regular fast forwarding. In the first case, I do not 
want to potentially send a list of all commits starting from project root, 
which currently can happen.

A solution would be to call the hook simply with
	update refname new_sha1
if this is not a fast forward.

The question is if there is a use case for the script to get the old_sha1 even 
in a rebase situation. So another option would be to call the script with
	update action refname old_sha1 new_sha1
with action being "fastforward" or "forcedrebase" or similar.

Or is there already an easy way to detect the fast-forward situation in the 
script?
