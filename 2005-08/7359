I'm not sure how done this can actually get before some sort of feature
freeze; the best ways to do things keeps changing as more convenient ways
are added. Once the new stuff is diverted to post-1.0, I'd be interested
in going through it.

It should be fine, but only if .git/refs is symlinked to the matching
place; this gives you the same repository with multiple working trees.
Having refs/ and objects/ directories that aren't always together would be
much less safe.
