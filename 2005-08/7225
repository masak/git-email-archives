Hmph.  If a repo is _really_ used multiuser then you should not
have to care about ownership.  If you can write into a
repository for a project (implying that you are a member of that
project group), and if your umask is set up correctly (meaning
it is 002 or looser), and with g+s bit on the directory at the
repository root level when it was created, shouldn't your newly
created ref file be also writable by others in that project?
