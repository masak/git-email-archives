They are not only not part of a standard installation, but:

o I was not able to find any perl modules in the  whole  Fedora  Core
  distribution that satisfied these dependencies.

o Manually  installing  Email::Valid  and  Mail::Sendmail  (plus  the
  required  prerequisites)  from  CPAN  worked  find,  but  RPM still
  complains.

That's what I did.

But it will work, as the required Perl modules are installed.


My problem is that I cannot satisfy the dependencies in a  way  which
gets visible to RPM. And this is where I feel this is a bug in Fedora
Core. But probably I'm just too dumb.

Best regards,
