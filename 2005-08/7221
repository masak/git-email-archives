"gt" seems free on my machine here.  I haven't poke around at all the
other ones that have slightly different sets of software, but searching
on the Debian packages search engine:

http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?word=%2Fusr%2Fbin%2Fgt&searchmode=searchfiles&case=insensitive&version=unstable&arch=i386

cogito in Debian seems to have taken it already for git, anyway.

We can make the conversion easy for people by providing this shell
script for a few weeks:

	#!/bin/sh
	echo "Don't get a git - use gt!
	gt $*
