That "Prereq:" should be "Requires:" instead.  "Prereq:" also
enforces installation ordering between packages; it is required
when the package has some installation scripts (%pre, %post) -
in this case all packages which are needed to execute these
scripts must be listed in "Prereq:".  In case of git-core there
are no such scripts (at least for now), so "Requires:" should be
used - then the package manager will be free to install packages
in any order as long as all dependencies will be satisfied in
the end.

RPM does not have "Suggests" and "Recommends" like dpkg - all
RPM dependencies are strict.  Because of this limitation, a
single RPM package is often split into several binary
subpackages.

Not only the names of packages are different between Debian and
RPM - the names of similar RPM packages are different between
different RPM-based distributions. :(

E.g., in ALT Linux distributions /usr/bin/ssh is contained in
the openssh-clients package; SuSE 9.3 seems to have it in the
package named "openssh".  There are lots of such differences.

Most modern RPM-based distributions have some mechanism to find
dependencies automatically (e.g., by scanning all Perl scripts
in the package for "use" statements).  But these mechanisms are
incompatible between different distributions too.

Different distributions also have different RPM packaging
conventions, different RPM macros, etc etc...

So the best thing you can really do is to provide an RPM package
for some distribution you choose, which would then be used as a
basis for packages on other distributions.
