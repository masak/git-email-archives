I'm all in favor, at least in the general case. I suspect there'll be some
things where we have to discuss the behavior, but we can argue that when
it comes up.

I think, slightly before 1.0, we should sort the library functions into a
new set of object files with matching header files, because "setup" is not
really distinctive, and there's at least one duplicate implementation
(the ssh subprocess code in your connect.c is the same as my rsh.c in what
it does, although yours uses two pipes and mine uses a socket).
