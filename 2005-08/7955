Dear diary, on Tue, Aug 30, 2005 at 03:19:36AM CEST, I got a letter
where Martin Langhoff <martin.langhoff@gmail.com> told me that...

I was working on Monotone<->git gateway and was indeed also on a kind-of
holiday. ;-)

I hope to fly through the patch queue and tag stuff by the end of the
week, if all goes well.

Sorry for the idleness,
