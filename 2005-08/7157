Dear diary, on Sat, Aug 13, 2005 at 04:12:26AM CEST, I got a letter

Oh. Sounds nice, are there plans to run this on kernel.org too? (So far,
90% of my GIT network activity happens with kernel.org; the rest is with
my notebook, and I want to keep that ssh.)

BTW, is the pack protocol flexible enough to be extended to support
pushing? That would be great as well. You might suggest just using ssh,
but that (i) requires you to be root on the machine to add new users
(ii) consequently adds administrative burden (iii) isn't easy to set up
so that the user has no shell access, shall you want to restrict that.

Oh, it must be nice in Oregon. I can't imagine anything like that to
happen in Czechia unless you live at a solitude or in some lonely tiny
village.
