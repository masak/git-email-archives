As others already recommended StGIT, I will just add a simple usage
scenario (I do this with my StGIT repository).

The MAIN/stable repository (or branch) is only managed with GIT, not
StGIT. The HEAD one is managed with StGIT (only, you can use 'stg
clone'). You can create patches, modify them etc. (I updated the
README in the latest snapshot and it contains some kind of tutorial).

Once you want a subset of these patches merged into MAIN, just pop
everything from the stack and only push those you want merged, in the
order you want (if there are some dependencies, the push will fail and
you can correct them or the order). When you are happy with the
patches pushed on the stack, just do a 'git pull <HEAD>' in the MAIN
repository. After this, doing a 'stg pull <MAIN>' in the HEAD one will
mark the patches already integrated into MAIN as empty and you can
safely remove them ('stg clean' does this automatically).

This way I found StGIT useful for maintainers as well, not only for
contributors.
