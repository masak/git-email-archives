Guys,

I was recently bitten by a cg-rm behavior where
it silently Did The Wrong Thing, IMO.  I think
that other CVS Converts might stumble across the
same pitfall, so it might warrant a comment in
the documentation, perhaps in the "Notes For CVS
Users" section.

I am in the process of doing some file merging,
resulting in some files being eliminated from my
source tree.  But I wasn't prepared to just out-right
delete my original files until some testing had
been completed first.  So I moved my files out of
the way so the build would proceed without them.

Later, when I was satisfied the build was good, I
executed a "cg-rm floof/somefile.h" and then cg-commit'ed
them.  However, I realized, they were not actually
removed from the cache.

Reading through "cg-rm", I figured out that it expected
to actually rm the files from the filesystem after first
proving they existed with a "find".  That in turn also
drove the "git-cache-update --force-remove".

However, in my case I had already moved/removed the
original files.  The "find" didn't find them and the
cache update didn't happen.  And no output was generated
either.  But I thought nothing of it; after all, "rm"
doesn't produce output when it works successfully.

So two possible suggestions here:

First, perhaps cg-rm should issue a warning if the
generated temporary file results in an empty list of
files to be removed (and then maybe with a --silent
option subsequently?),

Secondly, maybe the documentation needs a section with
"Notes for CVS Converts" section that clearly states
that cg-rm _expects_ to actually remove the file from
the filesystem, directly opposite the normal CVS behavior.

Thanks,
jdl
