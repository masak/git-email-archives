Following earlier discussions, I've setup a team repo where all
heads/branches are. We have many interrelated branches so it makes
sense to keep it all together. to work, we do single-branch checkouts
using ssh like:

cg-clone locke.catalyst.net.nz:/var/git/moodle.git#mdl-osc-ceed moodle-osc-ceed

now, after a few commits, I'm ready to push back onto the branch.
cg-push won't let me, and I kind of expected that. It says:

$ cg-push origin 
cg-push: pushing to a different head not supported yet

But git isn't playing ball either. What is the right incantation to
tell it to push origin to where it came from.

$ cat .git/branches/origin 
locke.catalyst.net.nz:/var/git/moodle.git#mdl-osc-ceed

git-push-script origin
error: remote ref 'refs/heads/master' is not a strict subset of local
ref 'refs/heads/master'.
error: remote ref 'refs/heads/origin' is not a strict subset of local
ref 'refs/heads/origin'.

I am not using the 'remotes' setup, because I want to avoid too much
setup of each repo/working copy. Is there a simple way of doing this?

cheers,


martin
