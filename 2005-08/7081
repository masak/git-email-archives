Dear diary, on Wed, Aug 10, 2005 at 04:38:08PM CEST, I got a letter

Thanks, cleaned up and applied. I only renamed it to cg-admin-cat since
I think it's indeed a bit obscure. Also, note the remarkable similarity:

        cg-admin-cat       [-r TREE_ID] FILE...
        cg-admin-ls        [-t TREE_ID] [PATH]

What about joining those to cg-admin-dig or something? (Catting a
directory or ls'ing file contents just feels wrong, although the first
one would make some sense to people not acquainted with UNIX.)
