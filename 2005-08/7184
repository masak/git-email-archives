Dear diary, on Sat, Aug 13, 2005 at 02:10:53PM CEST, I got a letter
where Sergey Vlasov <vsu@altlinux.ru> told me that...

Aha! Good catch, fixed, thanks.

BTW, I also changed cg-export usage to be more consistent and flexible,
by changing it from

	cg-export DESTFILE [TREE_ID]

to

	cg-export [-r TREE_ID] DESTFILE

since I think not many people are using cg-export anyway and much less
of them passing it TREE_ID explicitly.
