thanks! I was doing cg-branch-chg branch-name and it wasn't working.

There may be some surprises in here! gitk --all shows at least one
branch opening and merging back into origin, and it has figured it out
correctly: that was a feature branch where people worked on for a
while and merged back. I haven't had time to explore it more, but it
looks promising.

Except for the keyword expansion. surely there's a way to tell cvsps
to not do it. Why would we ever want it?

right. There are two separate directories in .git for them, so I was
misled by that. Should I assume git is safe from name clashes or is it
up to porcelain to deal with such minutiae?

Don't worry! Means I'll have to wake up and pay attention from now on...

thanks,
