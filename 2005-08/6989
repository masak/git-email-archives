The problematic one is git-send-email-script.  

I have to admit that it was a mistake to take that patch; I was
trying to be _too_ inclusive.  The script does not even read
from nor write into a git repository, and the only relevance to
git is that it is useful for people to patchbomb the list with
git generated patches.  In other words, the program may be
useful, but its usefulness does not have much to do with git, so
it does not belong to git.

My short-term plan is to downgrade it to "contrib" status, and
not touch it from the main Makefile.  It will be in the 0.99.4
sources but will not be installed nor made into binary package.
I hope Ryan does not mind this decision.

After we audit the set of tools we currently ship, along with
some other scripts/programs, either we remove it altogether from
our source tree, or create a contrib/ subdirectory and move it
there.
