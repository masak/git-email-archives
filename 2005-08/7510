Well, Junio has been talking about adding commit hooks. I don't think
that's been done. The idea being that you could verify that the thing 
you're committing follows certain rules (no bad whitespace added in the 
diff, sign-offs in the messages, whatever).

That said, git-applypatch (which is what git-applymbox ends up calling) 
does not use the general "git commit" script. So it would have to have its 
own hook. The script is pretty easy to read, though: just look at 
git-applypatch, and notice that the last stages are:

	...
	git-apply --index $PATCHFILE || exit 1
	tree=$(git-write-tree) || exit 1
	echo Wrote tree $tree
	commit=$(git-commit-tree $tree -p $(cat .git/HEAD) < $final) || exit 1
	echo Committed: $commit
	echo $commit > .git/HEAD

and that just before this thing you could easily add some sanity checking 
by hand. The commit message at that point is in the "$final" file, and the 
patch is obviously in $PATCHFILE, so you can verify either of those to 
your hearts content.

The only question is what the hook/trigger should look like. just put
something like

	[ -x .git/hooks/applypatch-hook ] &&
	     .git/hooks/applypatch-hook "$tree" "$PATCHFILE" || exit

at the line before that "git-apply" perhaps? Then, you could install your 
own applypatch hook which looks at the message or the patch?
