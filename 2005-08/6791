> By any chance, is this patch causing you problems?

No, sadly.  But I had hopes!  As I think about it more, there's no way
it could, since I have CONFIG_HOTPLUG=y, so moving the CONFIG_HOTPLUG
would not change anything (for those who don't know the patch, it is
appended below).  

My latest theory is that I fed bisect incorrect good/bad data.
Perhaps If I had checked out and compiled those intermediate versions
from scratch, each version in a separate directory, then I would have
got different answers.  Two possible reasons:

1. The kernel Makefiles ar do not understand every subtle dependency.
   So they might get confused by updating to different tree states (as
   the bisect progresses) because those updates change Makefiles and
   include files.  In other words, I should have done 'make clean' or
   'make mrproper' before each kernel compile.

2. git-bisect-script doesn't use -f when it does 'git checkout', so
   files that should be updated are not.  Right now I'm in the middle
   of recollecting the data with git-bisect-script using -f in all
   uses of git checkout (unless that is a really silly idea).
