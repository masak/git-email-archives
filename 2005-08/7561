If a patch is applied verbatim, or a merge results in no conflicts (i.e.,
only offsets), then you can run git-patch-id on the diff caused by it and
compare the result with the git-patch-id of the diff caused by your local
change to see if you've found it. Of course, if there was any modification
to the patch or a conflict was resolved, you won't see a match, but that's
plausibly correct anyway: you don't know whether the content change that
resulted from your patch really matched the change you wanted to make.

They might cause conflicts, but they're relatively unlikely to require
manual intervention, because the merging mechanism in git is stronger than
the one in arch (by virtue of identifying a common ancestor), and will
recognize when a section of changes made by both sides is the same and
produce a warning rather than a conflict. That's how the rebase stuff can
identify that your rebased patch is empty (when upstream applies your
patch): the content change that it would make has been made.
