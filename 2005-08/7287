Just wishful thinking, and a viewing things on a remote box over a
slow x11-over-ssh connection. When I think about it, it doesn't seem
possible either, so I better stop dreaming.

Makes sense in that context. On the other hand, if you are you're
migrating a project from cvs to git, getting rid of the noise is good.

And the resulting git repo will actually let you do trivial merges of
old commits after you've switched -- otherwise every file-level merge
will conflict, as it does in cvs when you don't use -kk.
