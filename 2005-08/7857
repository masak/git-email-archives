The graph things are there to be able to find common ancestors for the
heads we are merging. The reason we can't use 'git-merge-base --all'
is that new 'virtual' commit objects (i.e., the objects are only added
to the graph which is internal to gitMergeCore, they are not written
to the object database) may be added to the graph during the merge.

Thinking a bit more about it, maybe it is possible to use
git-merge-base after all...  I will have a look at it.

I didn't know you could do things like that with git-ls-files :) But
yeah, it's certainly less intrusive to do it that way. It will
probably simplify things a great deal too. Wouldn't '--unmerged' be
the appropriate flag to use for git-ls-files in this case?

I understand your concerns. It is probably possible to leave the index
in its unmerged state after the final merge. I will do something about
in the next version of the patch.

Ok, looks good.

I am going away for a couple of days and I wont be able to work on
this during that time. I will get back with an updated patch when it's
ready.
