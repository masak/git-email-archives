Although I think what you saw is pathological, I do not think it
is what you did that is wrong.  The same thing happens if you
have .git/HEAD pointing at some version, you have nothing
checked out, and "git pull" from the upstream which results in a
fast forward merge.  Only the files that have been changed
between ORIG_HEAD and FETCH_HEAD are checked out.

What is happening is that git-checkout-script, which uses
"git-read-tree -m -u", checks out only the files that have
changed between the "current suspect" version and "next suspect"
version, leaving other paths untouched.  This means that if
"other paths" were not in the working tree to begin with, they
are left not-checked-out.

This is because the 'git-read-tree -m A B' is designed to allow
two-tree fast-forward merge work safely in a working tree that
has local modifications.  The local modification in your case is
that "you removed all files".  This is further complicated by
that the low-level git design wants to work in a non-populated
tree and treats not having a file in the working tree a bit
differently from having a file that is modified in the working
tree.  read-tree.c::verify_uptodate() function says when you
removed a file that is recorded in the index, it does not
consider you have a local modification on that path.

The paths that were not checked out fall in the case 14 in the
Documentation/git-read-tree.txt "Two Tree Merge" table, and the
path is not marked for update in "keep index" cases.

Although I think what git-read-tree currently does is
defensible, I do not think what "git checkout" does is.  The
user is asking things to be checked out so it is not a "work
without files in working tree" case anymore.

Maybe we should check if the working tree is clean before using
git-read-tree -m -u and require --force if it is not, perhaps?

The following patch is not tested at all but I am throwing it
out in the open early, in case the approach I am taking is
totally going in the wrong direction.
