This is still wrong.

I sent an earlier email pointing out that removing trailing slashes is 
_incorrect_, because it means that "drivers/char/" will match the _file_ 
"drivers/char", which is wrong.

IOW, the trailing slash should not be removed, it's the _test_ that is 
wrong.

I just checked in a fix for this in diffcore-patchspec.c, I'd hope that 
ls-tree could get it right too. Removing trailing slashes is a bandaid 
that hides one bug by making it appear as a different bug.
