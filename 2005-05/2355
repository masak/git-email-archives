This would _not_ be "perlscript.pl" itself. This is the shell-script, and 
it's not called ".pl".

In other words, you'd put this as ~/bin/cg-xxxx, and then "perlscript.pl" 
wouldn't be in the path at all, it would be in some separate install 
directory.

But hey, if people want to be safe for bad installations, add the extra 
line. Shell won't care ;)
