Hmm... maybe the right thing is to make the implementation-provided
transfer code handle arbitrary things in GIT_DIR, but have code for
updating reference files atomically and using a reference file to start
from use "refs/"? Certainly, there's nothing special about reference files
in transit.

Certainly the things in the info/ directory shouldn't be treated a head
that you're going to pull, so that has to be different above the protocol
level anyway.

Hmm; I'm not sure what would be good for interfacing with rsync.

Certainly it's porcelain business what remote file to write; but I think
it has to be core business doing the lock, test, and update. I think it
would be inconvenient to go back to the porcelain layer in the middle of
the operation, particularly since it would have to go back to the core,
which is what has the connection to the remote host.

So the remote receiver should get an instruction: change X from OLD to NEW
and pull NEW. It should:

 - lock the file against further updates
 - check that the current value is the provided OLD
 - pull the necessary objects
 - write NEW to the file
 - report success

On failure of any step, it should unlock the file without changing it.
