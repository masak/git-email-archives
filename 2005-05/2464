	Actually, it is more than interesting.  The tree has gone from a
HEAD of 222222 to a HEAD of 444444.  When HEAD changes, you need a
commit to describe the path.  Otherwise, you have a breakdown in the
history.  cg-log (or any other command) would have no way to get back
from 444444 to 222222 (or Petr's 333333) without the commit object
specifying its parent(s).
	If you have made no commits on your side, then the old HEAD is
Petr's old HEAD, the new HEAD is Petr's new 333333, and he's already
created a commit object describing this.  You're just fast-forwarding.
