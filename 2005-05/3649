I really think it should be a totally separate flag to enable showing the
sub-trees if the tree-blobification wants this.

In fact, I can pretty much _guarantee_ that the patch as posted is the
wrong thing to do: it will do horribly wrong things for things like

	git-whatchanged arch/i386/kernel/head.S

(but I haven't tried it - try it yourself. The correct output for the 
kernel archive is just a single commit, and a single blob change in that 
commit).

My bet is that the patch will end up showing every single changeset that 
touches anything under "arch/", since such _trees_ will be marked as 
interesting. Which is absolutely the wrong thing to do.

Nico, try it, maybe you'll prove me wrong.
