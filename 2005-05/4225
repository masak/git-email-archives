Dear diary, on Mon, May 30, 2005 at 05:05:21AM CEST, I got a letter
where Jonas Fonseca <fonseca@diku.dk> told me that...
> [ Sorry for the resend. This should bring all usage strings in sync. I

Ok, I'll focus on this point (the rest seems fine). I think it's
inferior this way, since you are losing information, and for no benefit.

LOCATION -> SOURCE_LOC is fine in this context (if we would ever want
DEST_LOC, it would be better to stick with SOURCE_LOC, though). But
DESTDIR->DESTINATION is losing information. In cogito.txt you describe
DESTINATION as a general target location, but it's really a directory
here. And it's shorter.

I'm for DESTDIR here too, and what harm does the _ID part make here? I
think it's non-obvious otherwise - "TREE" can be understood as some
directory name too.

So what about bringing those in sync too? (Or alternatively letting it
be now and build the output dynamically in another patch.)

I think BASE_ID->REVISION is loosing information too. What about
BASE_COMMIT or something?
