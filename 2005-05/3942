Ahh.. You found out how to get CVS to check out individual files. 

The reason I use RCS "co" directly is because I couldn't figure out how
CVS can be made to do it. Of course, the raw RCS possibly also performs
better, but somebody should check that. If the overhead of using CVS to do
this is low enough, we should drop the raw RCS access, which should
simplify your patch and get rid of the need for "RCSDIR".

Anybody up for some performance testing?
