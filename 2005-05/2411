Actually, I'd almost rather just have git-fsck-cache actually do a
"read_cache()" and walk through that and marking the sha1's as "needed".

That's useful for another reason: not only does it mean that we don't drop 
objects that may be in the current index, but it _also_ means that we 
check that the current index actually has everything that it needs. I had 
that situation a few times after I did a "convert-cache" - where I had an 
old index file that pointed to the old objects _before_ the conversion.

I noticed it the hard way, and happily it's easily fixed by just doing a 
"git-read-cache <new-head>", but it was actually very confusing when it 
happened, and it would have been good to have fsck-cache warn about it.
