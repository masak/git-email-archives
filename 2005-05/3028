Unfortunately for this idea, you can't actually check files into or out of
the repository using the git tools without the index (in memory at least,
if not on disk). This is a bit like having a libc with all the system
calls except read and write. Sure, there are a number of programs that
would be fine that way, but it makes the API unintuitive, and most serious
programs need the extension anyway.
