[ This goes to the list because Davide can apparently receive the list 
   emails, but for some reason apparently doesn't like my osdl.org 
   address ]

Davide,

would you mind signing off on me adding the lines

  */

(If you just send me an ack and your "signed-off-by" line, I'll edit 
Nico's patch appropriately, and check it in with all of our sign-offs).

That way there's no question about the dual-licensing.
