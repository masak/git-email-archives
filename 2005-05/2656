I think I mentioned and posted an interactive version called
jit-trackdown.  It is part of JIT found at [*1*].  You may have
an older version that does not have the command.

Yourself or not, I think it is a good idea to do something that
does exactly Frank wants, namely, just list commits.  Even
better would be, to take commits with multiple parents into
account, list of <commit> <parent> pairs, like:

    $ git-file-revs Makefile
    f7eb55....... aaaaaa.......
    f7eb55....... bbbbbb.......
    aaaaaa....... dddddd.......

which shows commit f7eb55... changed it relative to both of its
parents aaaaaa... and bbbbbb...
