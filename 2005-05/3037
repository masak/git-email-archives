FWIW, I recently added .git/branch-name to Cogito, since I needed some
identifier through which to differentiate between the branches
(repositories - it's all blurred in Cogito view) when sending commits
to CIA.

It is strictly per-branch (never to be shared by multiple repositories),
optional, informative and more of a temporary solution for now I had to
cook together in a minute.
