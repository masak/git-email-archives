I'm no expert, but it seems the opposite argument could be made as well.
By signing (1)(3), I am asserting that (3) is, in fact, what I intended
the end result to be. If I instead sign (1)(2), then it is possible that
your patching tools might end up producing something other than (3).

Personally, I still like the self-contained nature of signing (1)(2),
but I haven't yet heard a security argument in its favor.
