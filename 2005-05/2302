I added a get_ref_sha1() that just does the .git/refs/ case; I think that
most things that want to accept various forms will also want to know what
form they got and do something with it, so get_sha1() isn't a big win.

The biggest thing so far is actually writing the references when the user
has specified where to write them, and I wanted to restrict that to a
target of the right format.

Agreed.
