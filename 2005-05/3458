That is sensible.  So the with --detect-rename flag, we do
rename detection and show only the changes, otherwise we do not
do rename detection and give pure old diff (two diffs against
/dev/null, that is).  I do not personally think --detect-rename
with --output-old-style-diff is useful.

Now, in the new diff format, if the rename is really a pure
rename, then we would have:

     diff -git a/nitfol b/nitfol
     rename old frotz
     rename new nitfol
     diff -git a/rezrov b/rezrov
     --- a/rezrov
     +++ b/rezrov
     @@ ...

that is, nothing until the patch for the next file or EOF.  Is
this acceptable?
