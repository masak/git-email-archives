Odd.  If I reclone the whole tree from the udev kernel.org tree, then it
works just fine.  If I create a new copy of my local tree, I still have
the same problem.  Diffing the trees shows no difference in the objects
at all...

Can you add a symlink to a local tree and see if you can duplicate this?
