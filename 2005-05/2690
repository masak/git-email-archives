To do that, you'd just have to always show the commit/parent pairs, 
regardless of whether it had a difference or not. That's actually what the 
first version did, but it was so ugly that I ended up changing it to only 
showing pairs that had differences. 

It would be easy to add a "--all" flag or something, that shows all 
commit/parent information, and then you would use that, but the thing is, 
you're likely better off just using git-rev-tree to build the graph in the 
first place.

So it's doable, and it has nothing to do with git-diff-tree. So normally
you'd do something like "show me all differences between v2.6.12-rc2 and
now, and then you _do_ end up using git-rev-tree first to make a list of
commits, and then you feed that list of commits into git-diff-tree - and
notice that when you did the rev-tree in the first place, you actually did
build up the history tree to get there, so if you want to visualize it,
you should now use _that_ tree that you already built.

diff-tree never has any commit history tree information available to it.  
It just doesn't know, care, or bother.
