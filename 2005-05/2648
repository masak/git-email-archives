Nope - if you want to serialize something, you'll need to write your own 
serialization scripts. git doesn't care, because all the git operations 
should be totally lockless already. There just isn't any reason to lock as 
far as git is concerned, since the objects are immutable.

The only exception is the "index" file, where we don't want concurrect 
index updates. So that is handled by writers creating the new "index.lock" 
file first, and then when they are done, they rename it to "index".
