Dear diary, on Tue, May 31, 2005 at 04:33:18PM CEST, I got a letter
where Zack Brown <zbrown@tumblerings.org> told me that...

I've rewritten cg-seek to use the magical tree_timewarp function. So
what it will do now is that it will save the local changes, then just
overwrite the tree with the seeked-to target and then it will reapply
the local changes. This should give much better (although still far from
perfect) results and reduce the inconsistencies popping up.

Anyway, anytime you are in trouble, cg-cancel is the way out! ;-)
