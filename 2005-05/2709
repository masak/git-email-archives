Hi pasky,

I have updated the patches I have previously posted here. They are
available at http://www.nitro.dk/~jonas/cogito/ and carry the following
changes:

- 0--move-date-to-Xlib.patch

  Move date conversion from cg-log to cg-Xlib so it can be used in the
  next patch.

- 1--human-readable-mkpatch-dates.patch: 

  Show the author and commit date in a human readable format.

- 2--show-changed-files-in-log-output.patch

  Add an -f switch to cg-log controlling whether to list which files
  were changed. The output looks like the following:

	<commit header>

	    * file1, file2, ..., fileN:

	    <log message>

  It doesn't do anything fancy like wrapping long lines and can be quite
  costly to do for big logs.

- 3--add-mkpatch-short-version.patch

  Add an -s option to cg-mkpatch which specifies whether to print a
  short version of the patch without a patch header with meta info such
  as author and committer.

  This was proposed by you after YOSHIFUJI Hideaki pointed out that the
  diffstat is not always useful. However, I don't know if this is
  anywhere near how you intended it to be. Anyway, it prepares for the
  next patch.

- 4--show-diffstat-for-mkpatch.patch

  Show diffstat as part of the patch header if diffstat is available on
  the system.

  I didn't test this since diffstat unfortunately wasn't available on
  the system I updated the patches on.
