Is it really the case?  I recall that Linux kernel started
shipping with the standard dontdiff file for everybody's use
some time ago, after enough people wanted it included in the
upstream release.  Maybe you would want to read from both?

What darcs folks do is that they have a per-tree configuration
(kept in ./_darcs, which is similar to our ./.git) that says
which file is the exclude list, and by setting configuration
item to point at a file which _is_ version controlled they can
share the exclude file.
