The unix commandline is an highly interactive enviroment aswell,
and supports scripting in addition :)

You tried to argue for re-inventing the wheel.  Fortunately you are
allowed to reinvent the wheel here (which isn't given anymore these
days).  Just don't expect any support from people who have been burnt
by that before.  And the Java world is re-inventing the wheel far to
often - I suspect that'll be cured when the community gets more mature
in a few years..

The C toolchain is a well-defined interface.  One that makes a lot
of sense.
