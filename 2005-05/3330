The problem is that to fetch a revision tree, you have to

	send request for commit A
	receive commit A
	look at commit A for list of its parents
	send request for the parents
	receive the parents
	look inside for list of its parents
	...

(and same for the trees).

You could still use it without the server side CGI script as it is now,
just without the speedups.
