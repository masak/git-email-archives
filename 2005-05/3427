That sounds better than the patch you sent last night, but are
we sure that callers would be satisfied if you just make some
_types_ more special than others?

Parse functions need to unpack anyway, so it might make more
sense to add an optional callback just after where unpacking
happens to ask the main program if it wants the unpacked raw
data to be kept.  So you would do something like:

    struct object *parse_object(unsigned char *sha1)
    {
   ...
                    unsigned long size;
                    void *buffer = unpack_sha1_file(map, mapsize, type, &size);
                    munmap(map, mapsize);
                    if (!buffer)
                            return NULL;
   ...             
                    } else {
                            obj = NULL;
                    }
+		    if (obj && keep_object_raw_data(sha1, type, size, buffer)) {
+                           obj.raw_data = buffer;
+                           obj.raw_size = size;
+                   } else 
                            free(buffer);
                    return obj;
            }
            return NULL;
    }

And put a dummy implementation of keep_object_raw_data() that
says "I do not want anything to be kept" in the libgit.a.  Main
programs that _care_ about raw data can implement their own
keep_object_raw_data() callback that is more intelligent.
In addition you give them the interface to free raw data you
already have.

Another possibility is not to make double unpacking too costly
by having an LRU of unpack_sha1_file(), but I am not sure how
effective that would be.
