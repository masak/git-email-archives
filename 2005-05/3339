I think that's wrong:


revision: a particular state of the tree, identified by an SHA1 hash ID

tag: a revision with a cute name

branch: a code fork, identified by name


As I understand it, a tag refers to a specific revision, and so when you use a
tag's name, you are referring only to that revision. A branch is different. When
you use a branch's name, you are referring to all the development that has
occurred in that branch.

So, when the 2.6.12 kernel comes out, Greg and Chris may decide to create a
fork for 2.6.12.x stablization. So linux and linux_2.6.12.x will be seperate
development branches in the same development tree. Patches and revisions
going into the 2.6.12.x branch will not be reflected in the 2.6.12 branch. The
two branches will diverge.

At the same time, unlike tags, their names will remain the same. With each new
revision, the linux_2.6.12.x branch will still refer to that branch with that
new revision. In the case of tagging, the tag name refers only to a single
revision that took place at a specific point in the history of the tree or
branch.

This much I think I understand. What I don't understand is how to actually use
branches. I don't see a Cogito command to create or destroy them.

As far as I know, you use only the SHA1 hash ID or a tag name to identify
revisions. Special cases like HEAD are the exceptions.

Be well,
