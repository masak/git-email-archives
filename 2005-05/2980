Dear diary, on Tue, May 10, 2005 at 05:00:33PM CEST, I got a letter
where Jon Seymour <jon.seymour@gmail.com> told me that...

Yes. And that's how it should be - the directory cache is just that - a
_cache_. It does not hold any permanent information, merely serves to
record git tools' working state relative to the given working tree. So
unlike the objects database which has well-defined format and is
supposed to be "public", you should view the directory cache as internal
git tools' structure. If you want to mess with it too, either use the
proper level of abstraction and call the git tools, or don't mess with
it at all. And you need to care about it only if you want the git tools
working on the same tree properly too - so in that case use the git
tools too.

 From your arguments, it's not clear to me what really is the big
problem with the git tools. They are _designed_ for automatic use
instead of human interaction - you can perceive them just as methods
with funny (but actually friendly to your programs) calling convention.

Kind regards,
