Dear diary, on Mon, May 09, 2005 at 01:28:44AM CEST, I got a letter

Of course. You should combine them both, the .git/ one having the
ultimate precedence (if we support the CVS-like ! stuff too).

That is, in CVS the version-controlled files are per-directory, which
can be very nice too; things are getting harder now, though, since we
should have some per-project ignore file too.

That is certainly a good idea (at least for kernel, where you probably
just want to give it dontdiff), but we need a sensible default.
