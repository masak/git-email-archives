it is your choice. I can change that if you like. My latest version
should apply cleanly against your current tree.

The -m has nothing to do with the merge message. You can have one of
them, but also both. Maybe I missed something in your latest changes.

If you want the extra newline(s) then it is a good idea to add something
that strips heading and trailing empty lines from the final commit
message, because otherwise it will be ugly if you don't enter extra text
for the merge.

Marcel
