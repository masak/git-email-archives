No, the algorithm is:
 - the email author, _or_ if there is one, the top "From:" in the body.

And the rule is that you never remove (or add to) an existing From:, since 
the author doesn't change from being passed around.

Put another way: authorship is very different from sign-off. The sign-off 
gets stacked, the authorship is constant, and thus the rules are 
different.

Also, authorship is more important than sign-off-ship, so authorship goes 
at the top, while sign-offs go at the bottom.

No it doesn't, the email "from" just ends up being the "default" if no 
explicit authorship is noted.

It would still have the same rules, so it wouldn't change anything but the 
tag, so I don't think there is any real advantage to it.
