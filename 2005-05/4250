Umm, why do you maintain two seperate "git" related trees?

Why not merge all of git-tools in, in a tools/ subdirectory?

I've been meaning to ask the same question about "gitweb" for that
matter.  The distributions that want seperate packages for dependency
reasons can handle that easily inside one tree, anyway, I believe.

I'd guess part of this is a holdover from the fact that you needed an
independent tree for BitKeeper, but does it still make sense?
