Dear diary, on Sun, May 08, 2005 at 06:15:36PM CEST, I got a letter
where Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org> told me that...

No problem with that per se, but please keep the configfile
infrastructure and the automerge switch as separate patches from this
one.

But I do. :-)

No. I think it's useful (and doesn't cost us anything) to have the
"owner" of the file denoted in the filename.
