Dear diary, on Sun, May 08, 2005 at 05:02:30PM CEST, I got a letter
where Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org> told me that...

...and I've just pushed more modifications. I'm so evil.

What is so special about 74 columns? Why not 75 (fmt default), or 72
(emails)?

Also, I'd prefer the empty line to be always there in front of the CG:
stuff (two empty lines in case of merge - I want to encourage people to
keep possible details w.r.t. the merge separated by an empty line from
the merge information), and when reading it back cg-commit should strip
any trailing empty lines.

We aren't too consistent about this anyway now, so you might as well
let it not clutter your patch. ;-)

Why are you messing with the $LOGMSG variables here?
