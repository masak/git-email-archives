If you use git-pull-script, it does this for you (except it calls it
ORIG_HEAD), and you can just do

	git-diff-tree -p ORIG_HEAD HEAD

to see the changes. In fact git-pull-script will do that for you, and 
output the diffstat of it.

Having the original head is also nice for when you decide that the other 
side has had a few too many drugs, in which case you just do

	cat .git/ORIG_HEAD > .git/HEAD
	git-read-tree -m HEAD
	git-checkout-cache -f -a
	git-update-cache --refresh

and you're back to your original head (the above is basically "unpull").
