Could you take a look at the latest round of the patch and see
what I did there makes sense?

    Subject: [PATCH 1/4] Add --author and --committer match
             to git-rev-list and git-rev-tree.

Another thing I wanted to ask you about was lifetime rules.
When we "lookup" these objects (and then "parse" them, which
causes more memory to be used), who is responsible for freeing
them?  When my program thinks it is done with a commit, is it
allowed to free it?  Or does the lookup machinery own all of the
objects that have ever been looked up, and the program should
not worry about freeing them to begin with?
