cg-Xignore isn't included - only called.
it's also just a library program.

As an include it should provide an arg handling function that the

I don't know how to do that.
I was actually aiming for glob matching when I came upon this in the
manpage.
I just thought it was bash and didn't think to check what version it was
introduced with.
