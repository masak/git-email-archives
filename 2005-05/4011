Yes, but git has been changing so much that I think it has made sense to 
have it together with cogito, so that you don't have version skew.

Have we gotten to the point where git is calming down? Judging by the raw
diff etc changes, I'd say no, but on the other hand, those are largely
over, and maybe we don't have any serious real incompatibilities pending
any mroe...

The object data structures have been pretty stable (thank the Gods!), but 
command line switches and some data output formats certainly have not.

The one big change I see coming is that I really want to make
"git-rev-list HEAD TAIL" work right (ie do a real reachabilty thing rather
than the date-based thing), at which point you'd _usually_ not need to use
the full logic of git-rev-tree that can do multiple parents etc. But that
change should be compatible, I hope (ie old scripts will continue to use
git-rev-tree and play games with the output, because they'd not know any
better).
