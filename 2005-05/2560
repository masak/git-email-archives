I had pictured the opposite, after the regular pull you would run git-pack to 
redelta/pack things to your local settings.  There's a ton of things to try 
in git pull for delta transmission, and I'd rather keep it separate from the 
local repository packing for now.

Later on if both tools are working properly we could look at combining them.

Yes, if Linus does take the patches, it's really important for people to be 
able to easily continue without deltas/packing if they want.

It's easy to do additional runs, but I would rather do this kind of fine 
tuning with the git-pack tool.  That way we could experiment with packing 
multiple commits into a single file, deltas on tree objects, or even 
combining commits based on which files tye modify.
