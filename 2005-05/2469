Is there a sane model to make git aware of tracking symlinks in the
repository? In the bk udev tree we've had a test sysfs-tree with a lot
of symlinks in it.

Where can we store the link-target? In its own blob-object or directly
in the tree-object?

How would a exported "patch" with symlinks as content look like?

Thanks,
Kay
