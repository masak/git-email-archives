I'm not sure if I was clear.  cg-pull should be 'cg-pull origin".

I take this to mean you're seeing problems with cg-update too. cg-update
simply runs cg-pull & cg-merge together, so running them separately
shouldn't make any difference.

I've seen some isolated problems running cg-update/cg-merge to a clean
tree with files that have been deleted.

Saw this this morning:

shaggy@kleikamp linus-clean $ cg-merge origin
Fast-forwarding bfd4bda097f8758d28e632ff2035e25577f6b060 ->
2512809255d018744fe6c2f5e996c83769846c07
        on top of bfd4bda097f8758d28e632ff2035e25577f6b060...
patching file drivers/video/intelfb/intelfb.h
shaggy@kleikamp linus-clean $ cg-status
? drivers/video/intelfb/intelfbdrv.h

Removing the file manually appears to fix it.
