The "finds logs of funny things" problem should have been fixed
by now, and I am fixing a big screwup now as I reported. I have
two ideas on speeding up diff-tree -C I want to run by you.

I have not measured things yet, but I think the big CPU waste is
coming from either expanding all the blobs and/or running the
diff-delta on many file pairs.  If that is indeed the cause,
then helping the upfront check in the similarity estimator that
refuses to consider a file pair whose file size change is too
big may be a good way to resolve this problem.

One approach, which I think is an unacceptable change at this
stage (but I would seriously consider if this _were_ a week and
half old project), is to record the blob size as part of the
object ID.  We say object size is "unsigned long" everywhere, so
I am talking about making the object ID from 20-byte SHA1 to
24-byte SHA1 plus 4-byte integer in the network byte order.

Since I think the above is inpractical, the second best approach
would be to piggy-back on the optimization used in uncached
diff-cache, which avoids blob expansion if cache says what we
have in the work tree already matches the object we are
interested in.

When -C is in effect, we would make diff-tree read the current
cache first, so that diff_populate_filespec() can borrow from
the current work tree when a path in the tree we are looking at
has not changed.  This would obviously be effective only when we
are talking about recent history.

Thoughts?
