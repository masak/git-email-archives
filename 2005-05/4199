Dear diary, on Mon, May 30, 2005 at 02:19:09AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

Ok, so this is what you get when you mix: sleepiness, performing only
mental experiments not verified in practice, and inattentive reading of
the code.

I'm sorry for bothering. Instruct yourself from my bad example, please.
