You said you do not do "less", so the following may not apply to
your usage, but I disagree your comment about "typing that /
stuff seems insane".  Sean's workaround to use "less -p '^diff
--git .*'" in a script, combined with typing 'n' in a "less"
session to find the next such line, would make it very pleasant
to use.

When I want to make a customized diff output out of the "diff-*
-p' command, I find it a lot easier to use the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
mechanism than parsing what comes out of "diff-* -p" and munging
it.  I am not _telling_, _ordering_, nor even _asking_ you to
use GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF; just suggesting you to consider that as a
way to possibly make your implementation easier.  I'd start from
the supplied git-external-diff-script and go from there.
