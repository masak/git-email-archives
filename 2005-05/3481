"These things" being the extra output from "diff-tree" that is not a "diff

If diff-helper just passes the lines it doesn't understand through
unmodified (_after_ having handled any pending rename logic), it will 
automatically do the right thing.

Goodie. I was hoping that was the case, but felt that the diff-helper 
thing should be pretty easy to do.
