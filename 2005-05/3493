Dear diary, on Wed, May 18, 2005 at 12:13:32AM CEST, I got a letter

Yes. But if you do just cg-commit in the subdirectory, it won't work.
You could pass the original directory in some environment variable or
whatever, but I think that's just not worth the trouble for Cogito -
it's much easier for it when you just stay in the directory you are in
and instead set the environment variables so that the git toolkit DTRT.
(I like this acronym. :-)

It was completely innocent. :-) How would it be a flamebait?
