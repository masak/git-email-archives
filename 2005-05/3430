It wouldn't make any types special; the caller can just control each type
individually, so that code that only cares about commits could get commits
unpacked, but not get trees unpacked even if it has them parsed.

I think that a callback is a bit excessive, and it wouldn't get the useful
information anyway, which is really: "what is supposed to happen to this
object, which you haven't seen before, after it's parsed?"

That reminds me that I should also fix the parse_object path, which can
now be simplified substantially.

Note that parse_object calls parse_<type>, rather than the reverse,
because parse_<type> can skip the step of figuring out what routine to
use. The parse_<type> version also has lookup_<type>, which can return the
struct which will be filled out later; this isn't possible for an object
of unknown type, since it can't tell what struct type to allocate.

It would work for pop_most_recent_commit, which parses the thing it's
about to return, but I don't think it's a particularly good solution in
general.
