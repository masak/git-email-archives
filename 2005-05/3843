Note that one advantage of the unconverted output is that while it's
unreadable and not very helpful, it _is_ the raw output from CVS. Again,
that means that everybody will convert the same CVS archive into exactly
the same git tree, and that means (among other things) that you can then
immediately merge between the trees.

Perhaps more interestingly, it should also mean that you can _continue_ to 
use CVS, then re-convert it at a later date, and I think you should be 
able to merge with somebody who has been using git in the meantime.

In contrast, if you have fancy name translation, the converted tree will 
obviously depend on your translation rules.

I dunno. Maybe the advantages of having nice names outweigh the 
disadvantage of possibly generating incompatible trees.
