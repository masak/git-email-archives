That set of users includes me.  I was hoping that this round
would not just change things to use argp, but at the same time
attempt to "fix" the problems around argument parsing.

I think you are responding to my "semantic changes" question,
but I did not mean to say that exactly emulating the current
behaviour is the requirement, nor I meant to ask if doing so is
impossible using argp().  I just wanted to see "the set of
planned fixes" while we are at it.
