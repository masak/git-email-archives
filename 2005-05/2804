I think using -E to commit even when you don't modify the commit message
is a good idea. The alternative way is to ask the user like CVS does.

You can do that with "cat -s", I know. But then you still have to look
at the first and the last line and delete it if they are empty.

I think it is a good idea to squeeze empty lines, because multi empty
lines are not useful for commit messages anyway. What do you think?

Marcel
