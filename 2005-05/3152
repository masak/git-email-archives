Right; and I'm not Petr, so the place that has the -t flag in ls-files
isn't his git-pb repository, and I'm not going to remember to tell him
about two places to pull from or two heads to pull.

Probably my biggest concern here is that it has to not make anything more
difficult for Cogito hackers (or people working on similarly arranged
projects) to have the other project demarcated as separate, or they'd tend
to be lazy and the upstream core will suffer. I believe that this is why
people in practice tend not to bother making projects clean and modular
with current tools. Having it streamlined and automatic would mean that
people in the position that Petr was in when he started would do it by
default.
