	Subversion encourages exactly this with the 'svn cp' command.
Just as knowing when a file was renamed allows you to track the history
past its first appearance under the current name, 'cp' allows you to
follow the history even if the original name still exists.  I have found
this useful more than once.
	Now, whether you track this up front with an expensive commit or
use tools to discover the relationship at query time (ala your
why-rename-tracking-isnt-needed argument) is a different question.  As
we all know, most tools ask the user to explicitly declare the
relationship at the time it happens with 'svn rename' and 'svn cp' or
the analog.  But git could do the comparisons, with appropriate
heuristics, at the time someone asks.
