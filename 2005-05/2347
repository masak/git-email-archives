It's not about environment.

It's about the fact that many people have things like python in
/usr/local/bin/python, because they compiled it themselves or similar.

Pretty much the only path you can _really_ depend on for #! stuff is 
/bin/sh.

Any system that doesn't have /bin/sh is so fucked up that it's not worth
worrying about. Anything else can be in /bin, /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin
(and sometimes other strange places).

That said, I think the /usr/bin/env trick is stupid too. It may be more 
portable for various Linux distributions, but if you want _true_ 
portability, you use /bin/sh, and you do something like

	#!/bin/sh
	exec perl perlscript.pl "$@"

instead.
