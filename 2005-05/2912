It could just create all missing parents of the object directory, which
would be better, at least.

So far, I have never heard of SHA1_FILE_DIRECTORY being used to target
something in .git other than objects. The only use of SHA1_FILE_DIRECTORY
I've heard about is my own in rsh.c, which sets it to [PATH]/objects,
because it has to write object files, most often, to
.../project.git/objects/. You can't really cd to /scm/git<delete> and have
.git/objects refer to the right thing.

My position is still that what refs/*/* gets used for is up to the user,
but the existance and format of the directory is a core thing. In
particular, I want to have atomic methods of modifying these files. (I.e.,
you give commit-cache a */* to write the result to, and it will make sure
that nobody writes to it or reads it expecting to write to it while you're
committing).

But even if this is up to the wrapping scripts, it would be useful to have
the same environment variable used by those scripts for whatever they want
to have in there.

The reason to tackle them at once is so that there doesn't have to be
multiple changeovers.

I believe that Linus's primary gripe was about changing the expected
location of the working tree, not about changing the expected location of
the git storage. So the .git location proposal is quite different.
