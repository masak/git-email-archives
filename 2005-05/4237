Dear diary, on Mon, May 30, 2005 at 04:25:14PM CEST, I got a letter
where Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org> told me that...
> Hi Petr,

Hello,

does it really fail? "... needs update" is not an error but something
between informative and warning message. (I've just committed a change
which silences it in this case.)

If the update did indeed fail, could you show the complete output,
please?
