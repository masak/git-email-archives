I do not think it is my idea.  Maybe I misunderstood what you
meant, but here is what you wrote in the message I responded to.

    ... There is a bit of convenience to having the tools magically
    do the right thing when you check out the child project, but the
    thing that really requires tool support is that you need to be
    able to find the version of git-pb which matches the version of
    cogito you're trying to build (and you might be searching the
    history for where a bug was introduced, so you may not be able
    to use the latest of either).

That part is fine.  I already agreed that recording such version
dependency would be a good thing.  I disagreed with the
"solution", however, of having that recorded at the core level:

    The solution is to add a header to commits: "include {hash}",
    which simply says that the given hash, which is from the core
    project, is the commit needed to build this commit of the
    non-core project. This comes from an argument to commit-tree
    ("-I", perhaps), and the parsing code needs to identify the
    reference so that fsck-cache stays happy.

I do not think the issues you are raising are solved by having
that "include {hash}" thing in the commit like you propose here,
instead of keeping it outside of the commit like I suggested.

What I meant to say was just I do not think having this "version
dependency" in the core or outside of the core would make any
difference.
