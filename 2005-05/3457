If you want to get info/ignore, you want to get it and save it, not
download a set of objects it refers to. So it's different from specifying
that you want to use refs/heads/master as the starting point for a pull.

There would be a separation between transfering whatever file you specify
and treating the specified (remote) file from refs/ as the starting point
for pulling objects.

Also, you don't need to do the same kind of careful update, since the
desired value of info/ignore isn't going to depend on the previous
value.

The way I'm actually doing things is to write NEW into the lock file at
some arbitrary point, and "writing to the file" is actually renaming the
lock file to the normal filename. So writing unlocks the file
automatically.

I think I'll get to implementing it Wednesday night. I might be able to
get the first step done tonight (my previous patch, except with the
transfer applying to arbitrary files).
