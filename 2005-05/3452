Dear diary, on Tue, May 17, 2005 at 11:18:18PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junio@siamese.dyndns.org> told me that...

Yes, that's my plan.

But that won't work good enough for me. E.g. when committing in a
subdirectory, I want to commit only changes made in the subdirectory,
etc.

Not even talking about much uglier implementation (that could be
remedied by calling myself recursively with some special argument).
