Which is complety error prone due to rsync. Some of the repositories on
kernel.org keep identical copies of .git/description already. Why should
they preserve an unique .git/repoid ?

There is one clean way to solve this. Managed repository id's and a lot
of discipline.

I expect neither of those two things to happen, but a complete working
directory path is better than nothing to make educated guesses.
Committer names (maintainers) can be the same over repositories, but its
unlikely that somebody who manages more than one subsystems uses the
same working directory for them.
