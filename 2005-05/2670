True.  At least usually.  Sometimes, though, we'll want to see the
entire history of the file, so we can see when it went (for example)
into Greg K-H's tree, then when Linus pulls into his tree, etc.  I guess
that makes "just when the file itself has actually changed" a special
case of the entire history of a particular file.
