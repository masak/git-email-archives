Speaking of which, for a large project, (such as the kernel) it is a 
pain in the butt if exclude lists only consider the 'basename' of the 
file, and cannot include any path matching information.

For a long time there were generated files in the kernel which had the 
same names as non-generated files somewhere else in the kernel tree 
(under a different path).  Making an automated 'take latest patch from 
Linus, apply, commit' was really a pain because of this.

Is there/will there be support for path matching in the ignore files?

If the answer is no, but people like the idea, I could look into it.
