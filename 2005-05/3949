cvs2git only wants UTC times, and doesn't do any conversion, since that's
the native git format (git considers all times to be UTC, but also records
a "what timezone was the thing done in" so that if you want to, you can
print it out not in localtime, but in "localtime as it was for the
committer"). Nothing else really makes sense - it's totally senseless to 
print it out as "in localtime of user".

Since the CVS information doesn't contain any timezone, it would be bogus
to use one, and the only sane git conversion is to always use UTC. Using 
the timezone of the converter is also bogus, since that just makes 
different converters get different results.

So I'd much rather see you add a flag that just always does the native CVS
time (ie UTC)?  Quite frankly, it's wrong to do anything else, exactly
because it makes no sense to print out dates in a timezone that has no
relevance (what relevance does Pacitic time have for somebody who
committed something at 8AM Eastern? _None_).

The fact is, if we depend on people doign "TZ=UTC", people will forget, 
and then people will have different conversions.

(My personal preference would be to _default_ to UTC, and instead have a
special flag that says "use localtime to print stuff out", since 
localtime really is the least relevant one most of the time)
