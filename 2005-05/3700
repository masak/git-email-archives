Not sure what bk did here, but you can do something like:

cg-pull origin
cg-log -c -r origin

To see what is at the head of the unmerged objects you just pulled down,
and if you want to merge then "cg-merge origin".  Although as far as I
know there's no way to have the log stop automatically at the proper spot.

cg-diff -p -r SHA1

Which asks for the diff from the parent (-p) to the revision (-r).
