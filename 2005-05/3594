No, this is wrong.

Or rather, it is incomplete - it gets only a small subset of the 
interesting cases right.

You need to really teach diff-tree about directory sorting, because it is 
more complicated than you think.

The sorting does _not_ just affect files/directories with the same names.  
It affects files and directories that have the same _beginning_.

The only correct way to do name sorting is the one that fsck does in
"verify_order()". To realize why, you need to realize that "A" (the
directory) sorts _after_ a filename "A file", because '/' sorts after ' '.  

In contrast, "A" (the directory) sorts _before_ "ABBA" (the band), because
'/' sorts before 'B'.

Side note:

Btw, right now I depend on "memcmp()" doing comparisons as "unsigned
char", which is supposed to be true, but I don't know whether it's 
entirely portable. So it might be that I should implement my own 
"namecmp()" entirely from scratch.

Does anybody know if some broken system does "memcmp" ordering on signed 
chars?
