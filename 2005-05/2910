Any arguments you give to gitk (other than -b and -d) get passed to
git-rev-tree, so you can just look at a section of the tree.  (I just
fixed a bug where it would crash if a commit had a parent that wasn't
listed in the git-rev-tree output, so refetch if you want to try it.)
So you can do e.g.
	gitk 88d7bd8cb9eb8d64bf7997600b0d64f7834047c5 \
		^a2755a80f40e5794ddc20e00f781af9d6320fafb

to see all the commits from v2.6.12-rc4 back to but not including
v2.6.12-rc3 (unfortunately git-rev-tree seems not to cope with being
given tags rather than commit ids).

Ultimately I want to add ways to select the range of commits you want
to look at, e.g. by tags or by dates.

So as long as git-rev-tree remains fast as the history grows, gitk
should remain usable for looking at reasonable-sized chunks of the
history.  There are various things I can do to make gitk faster, too,
up to and including tcl bindings for the core git library. :)

I think I am even less of an HTML expert than you. :)
