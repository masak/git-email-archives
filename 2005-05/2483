One thing about using a hierarchy of "tree" objects... as far as I 
understand today, it's possible for "git" to represent a limited 
scattering of files underneath the root, such as keeping one's 
configuration files underneath one's home directory.  Scanning the whole 
home directory to check in (or worse, out) files would suck.

On the other hand, having a single "tree" object for a large project 
that would have to be constantly updated would suck, too.

This is certainly *not* mutually exclusive; it's mostly a matter of 
making sure that if scaffolding directory objects are necessary, that 
they can be automatically added/created, and aren't exhaustively 
searched for uncontrolled objects.

OK, that's ugly.  I'm impressed.  :)
