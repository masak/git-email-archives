Tcl/Tk 8.5 will have anti-aliased fonts (8.5a2 is available on
sourceforge).  There is apparently some support for widget styling in
8.4 which I will have to look into.  The Motif look doesn't bother me,
but it does seem to bother you and Ben H. :)

Yes, it's nice that a relatively simple algorithm without much
lookahead produces reasonable results.
