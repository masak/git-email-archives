As some of you may already know, for the past couple of weeks
I've been keeping changes to the core GIT that came from
discussion and review on the mailing list in git-jc tree.  The
intent was to keep the things organized to save time for Linus
when he wants to integrate those good bits.

The purpose Petr stated for git-pb tree is a superset of the
purpose of git-jc tree, and currently git-pb tree is fully
synched up with git-jc.  I do not see much point in duplicated
effort, and also git-jc tree housed at my ISP webspace is
nearing the disc quota.  So I'm removing git-jc tree from there,
at least until I find it a new home.

JIT (my own Porcelain layer) will still be at the same address,
<http://members.cox.net/junkio/jit.git/>.

Thanks.
