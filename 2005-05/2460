My patch doesn't create any extra directory entries because the file for the 
packed file is unlinked after all the hard links are made.  Even if I kept 
the packed file directory entry, I'd adding one directory entry and saving an 
average 6-7 inodes per commit.

The best case for just packing is to pack the blobs, trees and commits all 
into one object.  Doing all three brought the tree down from 2.5GB to 1.57GB.  

The delta patch does pack trees together, but not into the same file as the 
blobs, and commits are not packed at all.  This is just because it is a pain 
to carry those changes around; it'll be easy to do later.

With the delta patch, the tree is around 900MB, I estimate packing the commits 
and trees into the blob files would save another 200MB.

Because space savings is so tightly coupled with packing ratios, a script to 
repack blobs, trees and commits from multiple commits will give much better 
compression.  Right now  the patch does not delta trees or commits, but it 
might make sense to delta the trees via the repacking script.
