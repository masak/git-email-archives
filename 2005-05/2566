I'll happily take the patch and just not use the delta packing myself (at 
least until I trust it). But before I take the patch I want to make sure 
that people agree on it, and that it's been tested well enough that it 
won't cause people to corrupt their repositories.

For example, I do _not_ want to be in the situation SVN is in, where if
you corrupt your SVN database, you're totally screwed. There's a real
advantage to not having fancy data structures or complicated consistency
rules.
