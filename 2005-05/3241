Dear diary, on Thu, May 12, 2005 at 11:30:32PM CEST, I got a letter
where David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> told me that...

But so is -L. And I'd just use -l...

> #. ${COGITO_LIB}cg-Xlib
> _git=${GIT_DIR:-.git}

...but it makes no sense anyway I think to reinclude this stuff from a
cg-Xfile you are including from other scripts anyway.

I'm sorry but this is really nothing my bash-2.05.0(1)-release supports.
We're already bash-only, but further reducing that to bash3 really won't
work. I *might* get convinced to add some bash2+-only feature, but only
if you'll be really good at explaining that it makes sense.

Besides, I'd prefer just the shell globs in the ignore file, as it is
done in the rest of the world, and in all the real-world scenarios I've
seen, the globs were powerful enough.

Also, how does this interact with git-ls-files --exclude and
.git/exclude? We would have two ignoring mechanisms...
