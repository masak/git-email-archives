The changes to sha1_file interface seems to be contained to
read_sha1_file() only; which is a very good sign.  You have
already expressed that you are aware that fsck-cache needs to be
taught about the delta objects, so I'd trust that would be what
you will be tackling next.

I started wondering how the delta chains would affect pull.c,
the engine that decides which files under GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
need to be pulled from the remote side in order to construct the
set of objects needed by the given commit ID, under various
combinations of cut-off criteria given with -c, -t, and -a
options.

It appears to me that changes to the make_sure_we_have_it()
routine along the following lines (completely untested) would
suffice.  Instead of just returning success, we first fetch the
named object from the remote side, read it to see if it is
really the object we have asked, or just a delta, and if it is a
delta call itself again on the underlying object that delta
object depends upon.
