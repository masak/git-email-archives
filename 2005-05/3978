Yeah, I'm happy. Sorry for the false alarm.

Anyway, at this point

	git-apply --stat

is actually already useful: it's a diffstat clone. Which is perhaps not
very useful in itself, but it has the advantage of being an easy way to
check that I do the right thing there, and may well be useful also for the
git-specific extensions (ie right now it's really purely a diffstat clone,
but there's nothign that says that it couldn't show rename information etc 
too, which diffstat doesn't understand).
