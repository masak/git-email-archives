I disagree here.  My experience is that Eclipse does not work well with 
command line use of CVS within one of its workspaces.  This is because 
Eclipse keeps too much "state" information internally instead of relying 
on CVS for all information about the state of the CVS playground.  This 
is one of the reasons that you can't attach Eclipse to an already 
checked out CVS playground.  The problem should be easily avoidable.

In spite of the above, Eclipse's SCM interface is the best that I've 
stumbled across and is the main reason that I use Eclipse.  I 
particularly like the ability to compare a file in the workspace with 
those in different versions, branches, etc.

So I'm looking forward to a git plug-in.
