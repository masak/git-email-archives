Indeed. It's also a performance issue.

If you do xdelta objects, and don't tell fsck about it, then fsck will 
just check every object as a blob. Why is that bad?

Think about it: let's say that you have a series of xdelta objects, and a 
fsck that is xdelta-unaware. It will unpack each object independently, 
which means that it will keep on doing the same early xdelta work over and 
over and over again. Instead of just applying them in order, and checking 
the sha1 of the result at each point.

Now, You probably want to limit the length of the chains to some firly 
small number anyway, so maybe that's not a big deal. Who knows. And I'm 
actually still so anal that I don't think I'd use this for _my_ tree, just 
because I'm a worry-wart (and I still think disk is incredibly cheap ;)
