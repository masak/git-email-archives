Dear diary, on Mon, May 30, 2005 at 10:00:42PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...
> Ok, I'm at the point where I really think it's getting close to a 1.0, and

Can we (well, me) count on the output format of the git commands being
stabilized now and not change in a backwards-incompatible way from now
on? I would like to finally remove the git itself from Cogito, but for
that I have to be able to rely on the fact that as long as the user has
git version >=N, it will work (assuming that Cogito is bugless ;-).

Is there actually much point in using raw git directly? You don't
usually invoke the syscalls directly from the user programs either (and
you usually actually use stdio for the casual stuff). I guess the
raw git usage can get quite long and tiresome sometimes.
