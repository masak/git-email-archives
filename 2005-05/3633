Btw, I do realize that I'm a total wiener, and that my inability to use 
"getopt_long()" is shameful and stupid. 

What can I say? I'm easily confused, and besides, I really seldom program 
in user mode.

So if somebody were to getopt'ify git, _without_ adding crapola like
autoconf (which probably implies that git would just require GNU getopt),
and others agree that it's ok to just say that we expect getopt_long() to
exist, then I'd not have any objections to making the above just be

	git-read-tree -m HEAD | git-checkout-cache -fqua

(to which the beavis-and-butthead in me says "hehhehhehh.. He said fqua.  
Hehhehh. fire fire fire.")
