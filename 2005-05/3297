Well, I did a fresh clone of cogito, and the problem went away. Weird.

But now I notice that some files from the broken tree are not in the new tree:

Only in cogito.broke: cat-file
Only in cogito.broke: check-files
Only in cogito.broke: checkout-cache
Only in cogito.broke: commit-tree
Only in cogito.broke: convert-cache
Only in cogito.broke: diff-cache
Only in cogito.broke: diff-tree
Only in cogito.broke: diff-tree-helper
Only in cogito.broke: fsck-cache
Only in cogito.broke: http-pull
Only in cogito.broke: init-db
Only in cogito.broke: ls-tree
Only in cogito.broke: merge-base
Only in cogito.broke: merge-cache
Only in cogito.broke: read-tree
Only in cogito.broke: rev-list
Only in cogito.broke: rev-tree
Only in cogito.broke: rpull
Only in cogito.broke: rpush
Only in cogito.broke: show-diff
Only in cogito.broke: show-files
Only in cogito.broke: unpack-file
