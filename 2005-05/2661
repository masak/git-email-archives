You've not updated your cache.

Guys, remember this command:

	git-diff-files

Just like that, with no arguments. It shows you what is different in your 
cache. If you get a lot of output, it means that your index file isn't 
up-to-date.

The other magic command is

	git-update-cache --refresh

and you need to do that after you merge.

If you use cogito, and cogito doesn't refresh after pulls etc, that would
be a cogito bug. But if you do things like "cp -a" of a git tree, and 
you forget to refresh the cache in the new tree, than that is _your_ bug..
