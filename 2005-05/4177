Dear diary, on Sat, May 28, 2005 at 09:33:44PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...
> This introduces diffcore-break.c, a new diffcore
> transformation.

> When the -B flag is given, a patch that represents a complete
> rewrite is broken into a deletion followed by a creation.  This

> 
> The -B flag takes the same syntax as the -M and -C flags to

Actually, I like this one - contrary to -O I can see how this could be
quite useful - I have wished for this many times when people would send
me some "complete rewrite" patches which I actually wanted to review.

Please don't give up on it. :-)
