Yuck. Thats really ugly. Right now all files have a uniform touch to them. 
For every hash you can locate the file, determine its type/tag, unpack it, 
and check the SHA1 hash. The proposal above breaks all that. Why not just 
introduce a new object type "dev" and put major minor in there. It 
will still always hash to the same SHA1 hash value, but fits much better in the 
overall design.
