LT> If you want to make it a blob (and have a use for it), go wild. 

Introducing "dev" type, as Andreas suggests, is wrong.  This
this should be done in the same way as you suggested for the
symlink case.  Store a blob object with those chrdev or blkdev
modes whose contents are of form:

    major=14
    minor=4
    owner=root
    group=audio
    perm=0660

This would impact the diff side least, and for the cache side it
does not matter in storing and merging.  checkout-cache still
needs to know about this.
