Hi Folks !

I have something weird happening with cogito. What I did is:

 - d/l & install 0.8 archive
 - cg-init <rync path>
 - built & install that, removed 0.8 files
 - a bit later: cg-update origin to check for new stuffs

The last one fails with:

benh@pogo:~/cogito$ cg-update origin
MOTD:
MOTD:   .../.. stripped kernel.org legal blurb

receiving file list ... done
.git/refs/heads/origin

sent 119 bytes  received 857 bytes  390.40 bytes/sec
total size is 41  speedup is 0.04
rsync: link_stat "/home/benh/cogito/origin/objects/." failed: No such file or directory (2)
building file list ... done
rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at main.c(702)

sent 17 bytes  received 20 bytes  74.00 bytes/sec
total size is 0  speedup is 0.00
cg-pull: objects pull failed

So it looks like it's trying to rsync to a bogus destination ...

Ben.
