Hi folks,

I'm not positive, but I *think* I shot myself in the foot by doing a cg-seek
when there were uncommitted changes in my working file set. The patching process
created duplicate areas in the files, while losing other areas and giving
patch rejects. Before I figured out the problem, I wasn't even able to seek to a
known state because of this, so I ended up having to recreate the files as best
as I could from the mess I was left with in the working directory. I realize I
could have gotten a clean tree by cloning, but this didn't occur to me at the
time. It seemed like the whole repository was just corrupt.

I think I recovered everything, and I know it was my own mistake, but it
seems like this will be a common blunder by users. Maybe cg-seek should
first do a comparison between the working tree and the most recent known
state. If the two differ, it should exit with an error.

Be well,
Zack
