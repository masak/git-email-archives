Dear diary, on Sun, May 15, 2005 at 11:23:12PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

I actually feel ok with this, but I wonder about Linus' opinion about
it.  :-)

That reminds me, the patches would be a little easier for me to process
if you followed the /dev/null convention. (You don't need to rediff your
older patches just because of that, or even bother about it if it's a
problem for you, though.)
