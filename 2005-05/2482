Subject: [PATCH] Terminate diff-* on non-zero exit from GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF

This patch changes the git-apply-patch-script to exit non-zero
when the patch cannot be applied.  Previously, the external diff
driver deliberately ignored the exit status of GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
command, which was a design mistake.  It now stops the
processing when GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF exits non-zero, so the damages
from running git-diff-* with git-apply-patch-script between two
wrong trees can be contained.

The "diff" command line built-in driver builds is changed to
always exit 0 in order to match this new behaviour.  I know
Pasky does not use GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF yet, so this change should
not break Cogito, either.
