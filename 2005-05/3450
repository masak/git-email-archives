Dear diary, on Fri, Apr 22, 2005 at 08:08:02PM CEST, I got a letter
where Morten Welinder <mwelinder@gmail.com> told me that...
> Hi!

Hello,

thanks. It was somewhat mangled, but the main problem was that it has
rot for too long in my queue, so only quite small part of it survived
until today. :-( I've not applied the CFLAGS+=-Wwrite-strings part yet,
since it would require some additional cleanups and such, so I'll let
someone else deal with that. ;-)
