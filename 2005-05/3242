Dear diary, on Sat, May 14, 2005 at 12:59:31AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...
> Created: t/t2000-diff.sh (mode:100755)
> +Mode changed: path0 (100644->100755)

Great, so it's even worse than before. :/

My issues:

* Highly inconsistent format. Created has the "old-style" mode stuff
while changed mode looks completely differently. If you look at the
regular diffs, do you notice any format differences between creating
a file and modifying it?

	Actually, I think it should just always look as

		@ Mode changed: A->B C

	where either A or B may be empty (for file creation/deletion).
	I can see no point in further Created/Deleted lines.

* Filename not last. That'd be much friendlier to scripting, then you
could just split the line by spaces and at a certain point slurp the
rest and say that that would be a filename.

* No special prefix. Even if you think I shouldn't grep (it makes no
sense to me to redo half of the stuff when I already have something
reusable done, for no apparent benefit), I feel quite uncomfortable with
picking up and interpreting random pieces of surrounding text which
aren't marked as special in any way.
