The time is already recorded.  Ie. the commit object is a separate file
with a modification time which can be used as a "local commit timestamp". 
 If you want to protect those time stamps by also recording them in a
separate file, that's a bonus I guess but shouldn't really be needed.

You can descend the history tree based on the parent position as described
by Jon Seymour.  That is, Cogito lists the "local" parent first, so you
descend that branch marking off visited nodes, then descend the other
branches reporting unvisited nodes only.  Afterward return and list any
unreported nodes in the first branch.

Of course, the problem with that is a fast forward node, where you can't
just blindly pick the first parent listed because it may belong to another
repository.   So the answer is to do away with fast forward nodes, or give
up on using the ordering of the parents to mean anything.   In which case
you have to pick the parent with the oldest local commit time as the first
node to descend.

So it seems, that rather than a repository identifier, we need each
repository to record the time of each local commit.   Either in a separate
file or just using the object file timestamps directly.
