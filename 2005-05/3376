Hey Junio,

Yes, it's pretty basic unless i'm overlooking something:

Rn---\
>    Mn
>    Mn-1
Rn-1  |
Rn-2  |
Rn-3--/
Initial

So for this particular case it's rather simple, the Rn merge node would have:

parent  Rn-1  (ommitted)
parent  Mn    Rn-3

Essentially, you are recording in the merge commit the length of each
branch that represents new commits that did not exist in this repository
before this merge.

But there are more complicated cases with multiple parent merges.   What
this would avoid is the need to calculate common_anscestor in routines
like git-rev-list, because that information would already be stored.   As
far as I know this information is already available at merge time anyway,
so recording it shouldn't be a burden.   I'm not sure it buys you a ton
out the other end, but perhaps it would be slightly easier to piece the
merge history back together.
