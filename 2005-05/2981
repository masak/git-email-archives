Btw, I rewrote about 90% of git in python, just out of curiousity. 
Performance is pretty competitive, and I can optimize certain operations 
by keeping the index in memory temporarily. It also saves a lot of output 
parsing, simplifies error-handling (if the frontend is written in python 
too, which bit now is), and the best of all: its about 600 lines of python 
code. I am all for a Java implementation. After its done we will see 
whether it works and how well it works. We can still throw it away if it 
sucks.
