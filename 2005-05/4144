I admit it is a bit weird. The reason for this was to make support for
specifying revisions with something as fuzzy as dates more usable.
Originally I modified commit-id to support it, but I've tried to move
the logic to the new cg-Xnormid to just give an idea. It is suppose to
add support for

	$ cg-log -r '2005-05-12':'1 day ago'

but for some reason it seems to only work as expected for commits by
you. That is it works as expected when I specify the dates for
cogito-0.9 and cogito-0.10.

Of course supporting revisions via date specifications can lead to
ambiguity problems when the date contains `HH:MM' because the colon can
confuse -r option parsing. This means that either a new option needs to
be added (-D?) or the rev1:rev2 case has to be handled after all options
has been parsed so that `-r date1 -r date2' can be handled correctly.
