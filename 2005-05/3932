A 'T' _always_ implies a content change, imho. 

Yes, that strange udev changeset actually had files that had the same
content as the symlinks, but from a patch perspective, that should
probably really still be a "file got entirely deleted" + "we created a
symlink with new content". Anything else just doesn't make any sense.

So in that way, 'T' really is different from 'M'. 'M' implies a patch
(which might be empty, of course), while 'T' implies that the old thing 
was deleted and entirely replaced with something totally different.
