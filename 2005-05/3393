Sorry, your proposal falls short, accurate work flow would allow you to
show every repository a commit passed through on the way to its final
destination.  Your proposal does not allow that; as discussed.  Nor does
it handle multiple projects or branches within a single repository.

As noted by others, using git often means the creation of temporary
repositories, hardly something that deserves an identifier.  Git, by
design, doesn't give a hoot about individual repositories.

And you also haven't addressed what to do when someone else uses say,
Linus' repoid, as their own.  It seems like a risk to have the operation
of each repository depend on a value anyone else can duplicate.  Linus
can't control what repoid everyone else uses, he can control the time on
his own machine.  Unique repoid's are an illusion.

Why should everyone else manage repoids in their own personal repository
for you; what value will _they_ get out of it?

> I accept that is irrelevant for you.

Personally I don't really care either way.  But you haven't given one real
example where it is actually needed to do useful work.  Making pretty
graphs on a web page doesn't count if they're not useful to anyone.  You
shouldn't force everyone else to manage repoid's unless there is some
value for _them_.

If you're still going to pursue this, at least make sure repoid is not
mandatory.  If a local repository identifier isn't defined, don't create a
repoid line in the commits.

Sean
