Sorry, I meant "rename", not "link", and yes, it should be NFS-safe. It's 
how all the mailers do things too, afaik.

As to your update-cache problem, it seems to be just due to NFS stat
caching. You generally should _not_ work on two machines at the same time,
but it probably does the right thing in the end.

In general, I would suggest using separate GIT repositories over sharing
them over NFS. As far as I'm concerned, I think NFS should work in the
sense that you can work from different clients at _different_times_, and
I'm certainly not going to guarantee that two different clients that work
at the same time against the same repository will get sane results.

For example, if you do a "git-checkout-cache -f -a" at the same time, I 
won't guarantee that things won't race on the working files. Don't do it.
