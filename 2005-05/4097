you could look into SVG (scaleable vector graphics or some such thing) 
that are supposed to be in the newest browsers (or soon to be added, I'm 
not sure). this should let you do all the drawing nessasary reasonably 
easily (if you are willing to limit users to that, which is probably not 
that big of a problem for git)
