Performance-wise. It seems to be quite usable, even doing just a plain
"git-whatchanged -C" on the kernel with no limits on what it does.

Now, all of the actual test-cases I looked at were actually parts of
patches where the source file _had_ been modified, so I didn't see a case
where it selected any of the random 17,000 files that were _not_ modified,
and I didn't double-check further than your commit message saying that it 
really does that, so..
