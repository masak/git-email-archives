Dear diary, on Tue, May 03, 2005 at 09:13:40PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...
> That said, I've been wondering if "git-read-tree -m <tree>"

-m fails when your cache file is missing/corrupted. Not that it cannot
be fixed, just remember to fix it if you are going to do what you
described.
