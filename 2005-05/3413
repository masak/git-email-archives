I'd like something like:

diff -git a/kernel/sched.c b/kernel/sched.c.old
filename -- kernel/sched.c
filename ++ kernel/sched.c.old
mode -- 100644
mode ++ 100755
--- a/kernel/sched.c
+++ b/kernel/sched.c.old
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
(etc.)

because I actually start thinking of the two sides as "-" and "+", and I'd
actually have to think about which is "old" and which is "new", and which
way the "rename" line goes, and so forth. I'd actually be happier with
just a "mode -- 100644" line for a deleted file, also. If I'm looking at a
patch, and I read Makefile with '-' and '+' versions of the lists of
objects, and then get to a "new file" line, I have to think about it to
associate the '+' side with having the file and the '-' side with not
having it.
