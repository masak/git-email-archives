I was thinking of server-side processing overhead, not bandwidth. It's
true that the bandwidth could be noticeable for these small files.

kernel.org seems to send 283-byte responses, to be completely
precise. This could be cut down substantially if Apache were tweaked a bit
to skip all the optional headers which are useless or wrong in this
context. (E.g., that includes sending a content-type of "text/plain" for
the binary data)

Yes, although that also includes pulling the commits, and may be
interleaved with pulling the trees and objects to cover the
latency. (I.e., one round trip gets the new head hash; the second gets
that commit; on the third the tree and the parent(s) can be requested at
once; on the fouth the contents of the tree and the grandparents, at
which point the bandwidth will probably be the limiting factor for the
rest of the operation.)

I must be misunderstanding your numbers, because 6 HTTP responses is more
than 1K, ignoring any actual content from the server, and 1K for 800
commits is less than 2 bytes per commit.

I'm also worried about testing on 800 linear commits, since the projects
under consideration tend to have very non-linear histories.
