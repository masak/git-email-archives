  Hello,

  so Cogito version 0.9, my SCM-like layer over Linus' GIT versioned
tree storage system, is out. Get it at

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/

  or just cg-update your tree. The highlights is cg-pulling over HTTP,
ssh, and from local trees, sheer amount of bugfixes, regular merging
with Linus, and few usage changes; most importantly, cg-log and
cg-mkpatch now take the revision specifiers as -r arguments to make it
possible to narrow that down to individual files (otherwise, I consider
the Cogito CLI basically stabilized, except for some cg-cancel vs
cg-update cleanups; but that shouldn't affect anything day-to-day,
except making the day-to-day stuff possibly easier again).

  This is mostly so that I can satisfy people hungry to upgrade to next
Cogito release. I know about the unmerged patches (well, at least some
of them), and will go through them soon; I have some of own agenda I
want to work on too.

  Have fun,
