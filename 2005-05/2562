Assuming that you want the PATH search rather than a symlink in 
/usr/bin, of course. This opens the door to forgetting you just loaded 
the CVS daily of python into your test directory and doing an unplanned 
test of alpha software, but if people think the application should work 
with non-standard tool chains, and realize it has possible unwanted 
effects, that's a design decision.
