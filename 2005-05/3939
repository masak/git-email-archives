I decided on it, and it's a hacky (but reasonable) decision.

"parse_commit()" always retains the buffer for the commit. It's very
commit-specific, since (a) that's the main data structure that you'd
actually want to retain and (b) of all the core objects (ignoring tags)  
commits tend to be the smallest and fewest, so this fixed policy has the
least impact memory-usage-wise.

If you want to free it, you can do

	free(commit->buffer);
	commit->buffer = NULL;

and you should be all good (but the only user I thought migh want to is 
"fsck", and that one doesn't need to, since it never calls 
"parse_commit()" at all - it calls "parse_commit_buffer()" which does 
_not_ do this, since the caller already knows the buffer and can choose to 
do it if it wants to.

Oh, thinking about that actually brings up a bug: mixing parse_commit()
and parse_commit_buffer() is unsafe, since the state of the buffer is
unclear. Normally that's ok, _except_ when we use just "parse_object()" 
(like we do in "lookup_commit_reference()"), when we really don't know. 
Hmm.
