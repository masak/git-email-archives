Dear diary, on Mon, May 09, 2005 at 10:15:20PM CEST, I got a letter
where Thomas Glanzmann <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de> told me that...

Sure there is. We are actually far from an early stage now, I'd say.

And what I don't want to see are commits with messed up author
information since people upgraded and did not notice.

You could use GIT_AUTHOR_DATE. :-)

But yes, I actually agree. When you are doing vendortracking of CVS
repository, you have one canonical source of the commit, and when you do
the CVS import twice independently, I think you _want_ the same commit,
since it _is_ the same commit after all (if the history is same too,
obviously).
