Linus, I think this is wrong.  GIT_DIR could be something other
than ".git".  I'd rather allow everything other than . and .. in
the core layer, and have Porcelain layer ignore-paths logic to
deal with "^.git/" (only when GIT_DIR is .git; otherwise
ignore-path configuration file for that particular tree needs to
say what to ignore).
