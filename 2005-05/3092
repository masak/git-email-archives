The point of this feature is to support other implementations and tool
sets. If there weren't other things using the git core, there would be no
reason to leave the current situation where cogito simply includes the
complete contents of git-pb. The relationship between cogito and git is,
however, not at all like that between Gnome and x.org; gnome could not be
started until X was essentially completely stable for several years (after
which X could be reimplemented and extended, so long as it retained the
same API). Cogito, on the other hand, is being developed concurrently with
git, and substantially informs git development. The current cogito doesn't
work completely correctly with any mainline git, whereas the current Gnome
works with every x.org release as well as any XFree86 or most other X
servers since the mid 90's.

Also, any particular user is probably only going to use one git-based
system, but will almost certainly use many different X clients.
