CVS nor SVN does not do pickaxe as far as I know either, but I
think some people in GIT community are already having fun with
pickaxe.

The amount of the code is small, and it does not impact if you
do not use the option.  I am more concerned by (1) the fact that
each new diffcore filters would carve out its own niche from the
scarse command option namespace; (2) you have to duplicate the
option parsing in all three diff-* brothers; and (3) diff-tree
is sometimes an odd-man-out among those three and it is not so
simple to unify the option parsing.  A help in that area is very
much appreciated.
