I very nearly agreed with you except for one thing. In a traditional
SCM, a branch is something that can be contributed by multiple people
but I don't think we want that meaning here.

Consider this graph where there is a main Trunk R, and a branch B and
two programmers Ba and Bb working on a branch B.  Thomas wants to be
able to form views of the merge order of 3 workspaces (W(R), W(Ba) and
W(Bb)), even though Ba and Bb are working on the same "branch" in SCM
terms.

Rn -------------
|      \         \ 
Rn-1 Ba,n   Bb,n
|     /             |
Rn-2             |
|       \           |
Rn-3 Ba,n-1  |
|    /             /
Rn-4 -----------

Also, most times in a traditional SCM, branches diverge, but the
behaviour we are interested in here is the repeated converging and
diverging of workspaces on the same "branch" [ I know, a branches can
be used in that way in traditional SCMs, but that is a degenerate case
of their intended use - maintaining paths of long term divergence ].

So, while I think there may well be some value is a separate
"branchid" attribute in a commit, I think they are describing
(slightly) different things.
