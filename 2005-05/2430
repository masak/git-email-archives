Dear diary, on Tue, May 03, 2005 at 05:24:19AM CEST, I got a letter
where Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org> told me that...

Hi,

when accessing the remote repository, Cogito always looks for remote
refs/heads/master first - if that one isn't there, it takes HEAD, but
there is no correlation between the local and remote branch name. If you
want to fetch a different branch from the remote repository, use the
fragment identifier (see cg-help cg-branch-add).
