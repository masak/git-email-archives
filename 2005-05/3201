 Hello, Paulus.

 First of all, thanks a lot for gitk.  I was working on something using
graphviz/pygtk to do about the same thing for a couple of weeks (and got
pretty far with it) but ditched it as gitk seemed much better.  I really
love how gitk shows the commit graph. :-)

 As I don't wanna ditch any more of my time, it would be great if you
let me know what you're currently working on, so that I can coordinate
with you.  Here are the things I have on mind.

* integrate two-way diff view w/ diff map into gitk from mgdiff.
* show the current cache and working files at the head of graph
* demand-load commits as the user scrolls down the graph

 I wrote a commit viewing utility (gitkdiff) modified from mgdiff two
weeks ago so I'm quite familiar with mgdiff source, and implemented
demand-loading of commits in my own project in python, but writing a
separate c utility with the same algorithm wouldn't take that much time.

 Thanks.
