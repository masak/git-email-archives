Dear diary, on Mon, May 09, 2005 at 03:40:13AM CEST, I got a letter
where Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org> told me that...
> Over the weekend I hacked up a prototype viewer for git commits in
> Tk.  It's called gitk and is at:
> 
> 	http://ozlabs.org/~paulus/gitk
> 
> (that's the actual script itself :).
> 
> It displays a window with two panes; the upper one shows a summary of
> all the commits with a graph on the left showing the relationship of
> the commits (each dot represents a commit, with lines joining parents
> and children).  The list is displayed with the most recent commit at

What are its advantages to git-viz?
