This has the advantage of working with any old "patch" version, but it has 
the disadvantage of being human-unreadable, and big. 

To me, there really are only two reasons to do rename diffs:
 - smaller diffs
 - human readability (you can actually see what changed)

and if you want to have compatibility with a "patch" program that doesn't
support the feature (like your example), you basically lose both of those
advantages. You have _some_ human-readability, but it basically boils down
to "ignore all those deletes/creates".

So I'd really suggest having just a flag that says "pure old diff format"  
or "new diff format with renames", and if the latter is selected, then do
_just_ the changes, ie the rename+change case would really boil down to
getting just

(except I think it would be nice to have the renamed names show up in the 
"diff" and "---/+++" lines too)
