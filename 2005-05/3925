I'd need some time to think about this in the evening (I'm at
work now) but I think Linus did '?' as an interim measure.  I
suspect 'M' would work just as well without introducing a new
class 'T', but on the other hand having them distinct would be
easier for people who read diff-raw format, so my knee-jerk
reaction is that we should use 'T'.  It's the same reasoning to
have N, D, and U --- they can be gleaned by looking at mode and
sha fields and there is no need to mark them any differently but
surely marking them the way we do now is much nicer.

More importantly I need to double check that diffcore stuff
including rename/copy are doing the right thing about type
changes.  If some of them are throwing type-change pair away
under certain obscure conditions, then tweaking the part Linus
added the '?' is too late to remedy the situation.
