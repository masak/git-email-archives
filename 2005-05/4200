Instead of inflicting a Perl script on us, maybe writing a
textual specification of what you want it to do would help to
clarify your thinking and help us understand the problem you are
trying to describe a lot better.  I think Linus publicly stated
he does not do Perl much.  I am OK with Perl but I'd rather
answer questions posed in a more reader-friendly manner, rather
than having to guess what the caller is expected to give this
"merge" sub, which you do not document well.

I think I've already asked you something quite similar when you
posted another part of your script for parsing the new diff-raw
format, which I responded with something like: "Without knowing
how this sub is supposed to be called, I think you are stripping
leading colon from a filename if there is one".  Anyhow.

Are you trying to implement an Octopus capable N-way merger?
If so, the way I would do would be something like this:

 - Accept N parameters, which are heads being merged.

 - Sanity check that given heads are commits, and N <= 16.

 - Initialize a set, HTM (heads to be merged), to contain all of
   the supplied heads.

 - Remove one commit from HTM, call it H0.

 - Initialize a variable, BASE, with H0.  This variable
   determines the base of the merge in the commit topology.

 - Initialize a variable, T, with tree associated with H0.  This
   variable holds the "current intermediate merge result" tree.

 - While HTM is not empty, loop over the following:

   - Remove one commit out of HTM; call it H1.

   - MB = git-merge-base BASE H1;

   - If MB is either BASE or H1, then you have a fast forward.
     Take either BASE or H1 that is not MB and update variable
     BASE with it, and update variable T with the tree
     associated with it.  Continue with the loop (i.e. Perl
     "next").

   - Run your usual read-tree -m MB T H1 and git-merge-cache; as
     Linus explained, if this step ends up involving any
     non-trivial merges, you should not do an Octopus.  So in
     such a case, if HTM is not empty yet, barf (i.e. Perl
     "die", or at least "last").

   - Do not touch your ${GIT-.git}/HEAD in any way at this
     moment.

   - Update variable T with git-write-tree of the resolved cache
     contents.

   - Update varaible BASE with MB.

   - Continue with the loop. 

 - We exited the loop by now.  HTM being empty means that T has
   the result of N-way merge.  Create a single commit object
   that has all the commits you have merged as its parents, and
   register T as its associated tree.  I would imagine recording
   that commit in ${GIT-.git}/HEAD is what the user usually
   wants but there may be use cases that it may not be
   appropriate (I do not do Porcelain so I do not know).
