The other versions are getting the tagged compressed object along with the
intended hash from an external source. They both verify the result as they
go (as opposed to the normal case which takes the uncompressed data
and finds the hash, and therefore has to be right). The common part is
really "open the file" and "close (and place) the file", which weren't
previously sufficiently complex to justify sharing the code.
