To make this useful you're also going to have to change the parent entries
to something like:

parent SHA1 REPOID

At least when the referenced commit has a repoid that doesn't match the
repository from which you obtained the object, ie. fast forward heads. 
This implies that you know the repoid of the repository you pulled the
object from!

Otherwise, you still haven't solved the problem of identifying fast
forward heads as you traverse the history.
