No the problem is you're seeing dragons.

Can we please not _invent_ problems where there are none?  Can you show a
specific case today where repoid would make one ounce of difference in the
life of anyone?

Why does this imaginary QA department use the same committer and author
for all of them?  And why is it you switch from imaginary problems of
dave, greg and russell to imaginary problems of a fictitious QA
department?

Wrong.  When a commit is pulled from a repository, all the surrounding
context of every commit that came before it and after it on that branch is
pulled right along with it.

Sorry, this one is entertaining enough <g>

No, you seem to want it both ways.  Sometimes it's important to you to
know where an object came from and how it got there, and sometimes it's
not.  Interesting blind spot.
