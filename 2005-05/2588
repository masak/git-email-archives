I think this problem can be easily solved with:
1) Restricting to auto-select empty commit as the merge base
2) Make an exception from rule (1) for first real commit

By (1) we will restrict accidental bad merges that can happen due to crasy 
operator - he will need to explicitly select empty commit as merge base.

By (2) we will allow to pull and merge projects that is just started 
envolving.
