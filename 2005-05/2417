Yeah, I got exactly the same behavior a little while ago, but thanks
to www.kernel.org/git, I saw that the problem had been found and fixed.

I had an older backup copy of all the cogito scripts, so I used that to update.

I believe the fix is this patch:

===== cd7a12e5d569d59a04823114c275a83d65b9f37e vs 437167273f77c0d5f039280d158b43324a79f820 =====

Hope this helps,
Steven
