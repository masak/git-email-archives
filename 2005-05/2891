> What are its advantages to git-viz?

As a kernel developer, when I do a pull from Linus' tree, the question
I want to ask is "who has been making what changes?"  That's why gitk
shows the headline and author of each of 30 commits in one screenful.
AFAICS from the screenshots, git-viz doesn't give me that density of
information (and neither did bk revtool, for that matter).

It seems to me that git-viz makes the graph topology the primary thing
and the details of the commits the secondary thing.  I want it the
other way around.
