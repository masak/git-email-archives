Dear diary, on Wed, May 11, 2005 at 12:57:34AM CEST, I got a letter

Chilling.

What if you have some files not tracked by git in the subdirectory?
Either you need to check for this and deal with it (Cogito's approach
would be to remove the git-tracked files and rename the subdirectory),
or not do it at all. Or at least please use -F or something if you
really want this and like to gamble.
