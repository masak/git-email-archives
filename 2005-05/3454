Dear diary, on Tue, May 17, 2005 at 11:20:54PM CEST, I got a letter

*confused* :) I'm sorry, I have trouble understanding this. Could you
rephrase, please?

I've been thinking about writing some FTP-like client for rsync, where

Of course. The porcelain file would just provide the filename.

Sounds right.
