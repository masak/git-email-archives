There isn't any. It's actually pretty nasty to do, following history 
backwards and keeping track of lines as they are added. I know how, I'm 
just really lazy and hoping somebody else will do it, since I really end 
up not caring that much myself.

I notice that Thomas Gleixner seems to have one, but that one is based on 
a database, and doesn't look usable as a standalone command..
