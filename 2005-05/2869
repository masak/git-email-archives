It's normal practice, and it _has_ to be the case. Otherwise the trees
would never stabilise -- every time Linus pulled from my tree he would
create a merge-commit which I don't yet have, and vice versa.

Unless a commit also carries a unique repo-id identifying the repository
in which it originally occurred, you'll only ever be able to track
history in the way people want by means of heuristics.
