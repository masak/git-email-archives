Hi,

git tracker is online in a beta version:

http://www.tglx.de/gittracker

It does:
- multi repository tracking
- Tree browsing
- File revision history
- File diffs
- File annotation
- commit viewer with filtering (e.g. all commits in a tree which are not
in another tree)

The file histories and annotations are partially messed due to the
missing information about head forward merges. Its a pity that there
seems to be no interest to solve this problem really. It might be not
important for some of you, but it is often quite helpful to have
consistent information across multiple trees available.

The simplest solution would be a head order list per repository, which
is updated every time when the head is changed. Thats a non intrusive
feature, which could be simply added to the current tools. 

tglx
