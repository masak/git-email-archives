Personally what I think is that grepping in the diff, especially
if the diff is something you are generating (I am assuming that
you are taling about cg-diff fed to cg-patch to port work tree
changes forward), is a wrong way to do things.

The way JIT does the equivalent is via git-apply-patch-script.
You run git-diff-{files,cache,tree}, setting GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
environment variable to git-apply-patch-script, and have the
apply-patch-script to take care of the mode changes, creation,
etc.  See the implementation of the jit-patch command if you are
interested.
