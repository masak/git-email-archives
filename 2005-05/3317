I am having a bit hard time understanding how the end user uses
what you are trying to give them.  Is the basic idea to let them
say "I want to get Pasky's $GIT_DIR/refs/heads/master and store
it in my $GIT_DIR/refs/heads/git-pb, and then I want to start
the pull starting from the commit recorded in that ref"?

Assuming that is what you are doing, I do not have much
objection to it.  I however think introducing REFS_ENVIRONMENT
is going overboard.

My understanding of the definition of GIT_DIR is "the directory
traditionally known as $(pwd)/.git/ where various things hang
underneath".  We have GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY configurable to be
set to something other than $GIT_DIR/objects because people may
want to use shared object pools.  We have GIT_INDEX_FILE
configurable to be set to something other than $GIT_DIR/index
because being able to have it on tmp filesystem for some
application (like "merge my head and his head without using what
I have in my work dir which is a bit ahead of my head already")
helps performance; also some Porcelain operations benefit from
being able to switch between multiple cache files.  I cannot
think of a similar argument with an example use pattern that
justifies REFS_ENVIRONMENT being set to anything other than
$GIT_DIR/refs/.
