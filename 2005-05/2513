Hmm.. It's still not there a few hours later. I wonder what the mirroring
rules are. Or maybe mirroring is just broken right now. Peter?

One change introduced by me is that the new objects changed from 0664
(-rw-rw-r--) to (0444) -r--r--r-- due to the object writing rules. Maybe
the mirroring decides that such objects shouldn't be mirrored, since they
are "private"?

Or maybe it's just that Peter has shut down mirroring in preparation for 
the imminent memory upgrade on master.kernel.org.
