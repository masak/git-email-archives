I had intended it only as a quick check by an end-user before doing
a commit that the values had been set as desired.

My simple testing didn't result in any meaningful whitespace loss,
but I only had a single blank character inside my test strings.  Your
method is better.

[steven@spc cogito]$ echo "AUTHOR_NAME="$AUTHOR_NAME
AUTHOR_NAME=Homer Simpson
[steven@spc cogito]$ echo COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME=Two  Spaces  Here

If Petr wants to add this command, he can either move the double quotes
or I can submit a modified patch.
