Reasonable.  Another use would be to have a repository with
"ancient history" (e.g., Linux pre-2.6) that isn't normally
loaded or looked at, but COULD be looked at if you added
that repository.  For that use, though, you'd need a way to
record "the parent of X is Y" since the information creating
connections BETWEEN the repositories might not be stored in
the later repository itself (see the discussions about Linux kernel
history recreation).
