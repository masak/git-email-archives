	RELNAME=`cg-tag-ls | grep -v 'git' | tail -n1 | cut -f1 | sed s/^v//`

this seems to assume that cg-tag-ls outputs things in the right order, 
which I'm not at all sure it does.

It looks like cg-tag-ls just does

	cd .git/refs/tags
	for tag in *; do
		...

which means that the ordering will depend on the shell ordering or 
globbing.

Bash does globbing alphabetically sorted (and documents that), and it's
quite possible that all other shells do too. Even so, that doesn't
actually mean that it would be sorted by release, since v2.6.2 will sort
_after_ v2.6.12.

So this _should_ work for a while, but will eventually (before a -rc10
happens or we get to v2.6.100 ;^) need something better. That something
better probably being to ignore any tags that don't point to commits, and
then sorting by the date of the commit object.
