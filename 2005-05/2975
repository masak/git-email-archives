I'd guess that an Eclipse plugin wouldn't have a on-disk cache at all,
since it expects to keep the same address space through a whole day's
work.

The two clients should be able to interoperate trivially; the C version
would just treat the Java one as a text editor whose modifications happen
to match commits going into the same head; as soon as the C user does
either read-tree or update-cache, everything will be seen to be consistent
again.

I think this is nonsensical. The cache format is tied to the way in which
the repository accessing code is written, so a git-core separate from the
cache wouldn't have a useful set of code.

It might be worthwhile to produce a separate document describing the
repository format, such that it could be accessed by different code,
however. Of course, the index file wouldn't be part of this documentation,
for the same reason that the public git repositories don't include index
files.
