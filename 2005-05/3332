I have just put version 0.91 of gitk on ozlabs.org at:

	http://ozlabs.org/~paulus/gitk-0.91

(that's the actual script, just wget it and run it).

New features in version 0.91 include a menu bar, a widget to show the
SHA1 id of the selected commit, a find facility for searching for
commits, better error handling, and the ability to increase and
decrease the font size with control-KP+ and control-KP- (and
control-equal and control-minus).

Gitk is a commit viewer written in Tcl/Tk.  Its main features are a
compact and clear representation of the commit graph and the fact that
it shows the headline, author and date of each commit in the summary
window, allowing developers to scan quickly through a large number of
commits and home in on the ones of interest to them.  When a commit is
selected, the full commit message is shown, along with the colorized
diff for commits that have one parent.

Apart from the -b (use bold font for names), -c (color the commit
graph according the the committer) and -d (order commits by date)
options, all other arguments to gitk are passed to git-rev-tree to
allow the user to specify which commits to display.

Paul.
