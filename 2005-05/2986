I guess I agree it is somewhat nonsensical if one considers the
current git toolset as a collection of programs - the exercise now
might simply reduce to classifying git tools as
index-using/non-index-using and nothing more. However, it might be
worth keeping in mind when/if the "libification" of git happens so
that there is a clean separation of layers in the API between the
repository API and index/cache/workspace API.

And thanks for your constructive criticism.
