Sorry for replying after so much time, it looks like I missed this and
got here only after checking what change removed the mode: bits...

I'd personally prefer something like

	@.Mode change:

that is, using a '@.' prefix for those. It seems to be unique enough and
'@' is one of the four magic characters prefixing diff lines. Just using
the plain string seems too volatile, and I need to grep all the
interesting bits out of the diff file. This is because patch can
otherwise complain "only garbage found in the patch" when processing the
diff, which confuses my users greatly.

What do you think?
