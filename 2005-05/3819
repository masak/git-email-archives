I didn't mean that YOUR repository had more pathological stuff in it, 
just that SOME do.  'FUNKY' tags are not really that bad, it's just that 
there is not a single commit to assign them to (i.e. at no point were 
all of the objects in the repository at that state simultaneously), 
which makes the import of such a tag difficult into a more commit 
oriented system.

Another way to reach 'funky'ness is to modify a file, commit and tag, 
without having done a 'cvs update' first (and a colleague has done a 
commit since your last 'cvs update')
