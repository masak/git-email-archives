Well, my "tools" thing really isn't git proper, and may not make much 
sense in the git distribution.

That said, I'm actually moving things into git as they turn useful. For 
example, I move the "stripspace" program into git (which means it got 
renamed into "git-stripspace", since it ended up being useful for the 
stand-alone git-commit-scripts too. 

But how many non-Linux projects really apply mailboxes of patches? It 
doesn't seem to be very "core".

I'll think about it. It does look like at least about half of the git
tools end up being pretty core.

Well, there the issue definitely boils down to "different maintainers". I 
don't want to connect things that don't need to be connected.

Well, I see the "tools" thing really as my private tools that may or may
not make sense for anybody else. Even the cvs2git thing is just so
_stupid_, since I bet you can do it quite cleanly in perl without having
that strange "convert cvsps output into a shellscript" stage (admittedly,
it was _really_ convenient for debugging to have that separate stage, so
while it looks a bit hacky, it ended up being very powerful).
