Yes.  The 'chunking' code I posted earlier does this, etc.  It's kinda odd 
computing a SHA-1 including the 'blob <size>\0' header, even when your 
representation doesn't use this type exactly, but it's no big deal.  I'm 
still tinkering with this, btw; I can get modest improvements in 'real' disk 
space used, but nothing earth-shattering (yet).  I'll post the list of 
things I tried and how well they worked at some point, just to save people 
the effort of retrying things.

I've been working from the 'no knowledge of commit structure needed' 
perspective; I think Chris Mason has been using the structure of the 
commit object to guide delta-fication and showing more impressive 
space savings.
