Let me make sure I understand you correctly before I go
further.  In the above sentence, do you mean a merge that is
_successful_ by merges that:

    (1) "git-remove-tree -m" considers them trivial;

or
    (2) in addition to (1), "git-merge-one-file-script"
        considers them trivial.  That is, only one-side changes
        or removes or adds it, or both sides adds it
        identically, or merge/diff3 merges without conflict.

Which one?

LT> Sounds sane.

I am undecided on this one but having worked on the diff side, I
think the magic SHA1 of 0{40} would match better with what diff
needs to do.  It would mean "cache is stale, look in the work
tree" to them.
