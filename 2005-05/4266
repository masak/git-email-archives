I have a somewhat stale copy of Tk 8.5 CVS and Tile CVS here.  I tried
gitk on it.  I added the lines
    package require tile; namespace import -force ::ttk::*
    tile::setTheme alt
near the top, which is a simple way to use the new "tile" theme engine
with an included, redmond-style theme.

Here's a screenshot:
    http://emergent.unpy.net/index.cgi-files/sandbox/gitk-tk85+tile.png

I have no idea why the menu is in greek.  The rest of the buttons and
labels were too, before I switched to Tile for rendering them.

I get an odd traceback that I don't get using the same gitk with
tcl-8.4.5:
    number too large to represent as a Posix time
        while executing
    "return -options $opts $retval"
        (procedure "ConvertUTCToLocal" line 20)
        invoked from within
    "ConvertUTCToLocal $date[set date {}] $timezone"
        (procedure "::tcl::clock::format" line 10)
        invoked from within
    "clock format $audate -format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S""
        (procedure "readcommit" line 37)
        invoked from within
    "readcommit $p"
        (procedure "drawgraph" line 52)
        invoked from within
    "drawgraph"
        ("after" script)
which stops the graph before it's complete.  Laying out the graph seems
much slower than with tk8.4.
