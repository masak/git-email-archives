It seems to me like projects like cogito which are based on a core which
is itself a project and which is also part of other projects would benefit
from some sort of support.

In particular, it would be nice if Linus could pull the changes to the
core without getting the wrapper programs at all.

I'm thinking something like having a head for cogito and a head for git in
the same repository, where the trees for git only have the core files, and
the commits for cogito have, in addition to a tree with only the
cogito-specific files, a reference to a git commit that they include.

It seems to me like this area contains a brilliant idea that I haven't
had so far, and maybe someone can come up with it.
