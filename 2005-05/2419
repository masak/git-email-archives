    I've made a proposal like the following:

    .git/
      objects/    (traditional)
      refs/       Directories of hex SHA1 + newline files
        heads/    Commits which are heads of various sorts
        tags/     Tags, by the tag name (or some local renaming of it)
      info/       Other shared information
        remotes
      ...         Everything else isn't shared
      HEAD        Symlink to refs/heads/<something>

    The plumbing doesn't care what you name heads or tags, but expects things
    to be in heads to be commit objects and tags to be tag objects (which can
    tag whatever).

    AFAICT, there is general concensus that this is how things should be, but
    I haven't convinced Linus that the plumbing should know about anything
    other than objects/.
