Disregard my last MB(A,A)===A thing.  I really was not thinking,

merge-base which always does two heads at a time, rev-tree works
N-way.  You should be able to give many heads to it and have it
help you figure out the ancestory relationship across them.

I think you can run the same algorithm for those pairwise
ancestors and favor the less common ones.  In the above drawing,
you would first find out the three common pair-wise ancestors.

In your drawing,

    GCA(A,B) = GCA#1
    GCA(B,C) = GCA#2
    GCA(C,A) = GCA#1
    GCA(GCA#1,GCA#2) = GCA#1

Then you notice that GCA#2 is less common than GCA#1 (indeed
GCA#1 is contained in GCA#2).  So favoring the GCA#2, you do the
merge pair that uses it as the merge base, namely B and C,
first.

You scan the pairwise list again and find the pair that have not
merged and uses the least common GCA as merge base and keep
going.  For the definition of less common, in many cases those
GCA#n would not be related at all and cannot be compared by
topology only, so you would probably need to come up with a
heuristics to break such ties.  Off the top of my head, you
could compare commit timestamps (prefer younger), sum of commit
chain length from GCA#n to its two head pairs (prefer shorter),
sum of number of changed files from GCA#n to its two head pairs
(prefer smaller).

TG>     /----- A -------D---E
TG>    /               /   /
TG> -GCA------GCA---- B   /
TG>             \------- C

TG> Where D is a temporary COMMIT obeject to use the second GCA to merge C

Yes, if you ended up merging A and B first you would have
something like that.  I think you should not do that in the
first place, and try to merge the "most recently diverged" pair
first, like this:

         /----- A -----------Y
        /                   / 
     -GCA#1---GCA#2--- B --X
                 \---- C -/

If we are still talking about Octopus (Tripus in this case), you
would not want to actually make a commit X.  When you merge B
and C, you consider that such a resulting tree resides at GCA#2
(merge base of B and C) for the purposes of further merge
computation.  Then you merge that resulting tree with A, using
GCA#1.
