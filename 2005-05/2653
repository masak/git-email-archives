I already explained why mine sucks and shouldn't be merged. It was a
proof of concept; hoping for the stone soup effect.

I haven't seen a C version or indeed anything which actually does the
right thing, although I outlined how it would work and _threatened_ to
do one. I had a half-arsed attempt at it on the way home from
linux.conf.au but my brain tends to melt while I'm on airplanes so I
didn't get very far.
