Here, I would like more people to speak up, plaese, especially the
authors of other layers over git than Cogito, since I think it'd be
great if we could agree on common ignore rules format and we could just
call the files ".gitignore" instead of ".cgignore", ".jitignore" etc.


Dear diary, on Sat, May 14, 2005 at 05:13:08PM CEST, I got a letter
where David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> told me that...
> I was wondering about supporting _both_ globs and re's

I assume \# will override that?

> maybe re: precedes regexp lines and unadorned lines are globs.

Or maybe even /, which is the common regexp prefix anyway...

To mention it in this mail too, I think leading '!' should do the
"ignore exclude" - that is, it would override any possible previous
ignore decisions about the file. E.g. '!*' would throw away all
previously applied ignore rules.

If there is still a serious plan, it is much more long-term now, since
shell turns out to keep doing fine and everything we need, and that all
reasonably fast.

That said, I think it's fine to use Perl regexps. I think they rule. :-)
But what do others think? Should we stick with POSIX regexps (I assume
at least extended instead of basic), or go with Perl regexps?

If we get to agree on some common format, I'm thinking whether it
wouldn't be actually good to extend the --exclude option to support it.
How much of an issue would that be? What do others think?

I imagine it as (ignore rules applied in this order):

<default ignore list>:

Some builtin ignore list catching files like *.o, *.a and such.
Remember that you can throw it away with !* if you don't like it.

/.git/ignore:

Per-repository ignore list, not version tracked etc; really a local thing.

/.gitignore
/**/.gitignore:

(Applied in the order from the project root to the current directory.)
Version tracked ignore list, which concerns the current directory, BUT
may match pathnames instead of just filenames (but no ..). That is, you
could do something like

	echo '*.o' >.gitignore

to ignore all the object files in the current directory, and

	echo '**.o' >.gitignore

to also ignore the object files in all the subdirectories.


Opinions?
