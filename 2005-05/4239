I don't see failures, but I do see the "needs update" message often when
I do cg-update. If I run cg-update a second time it says the tree is fully
up-to-date. However, if I then do a cg-diff, I will see tons of diff output.
This is on a tree (the kernel) that I haven't modified at all, I only track it
with cg-update.

I also track Cogito, and I use the latest form of all git and Cogito tools.
Maybe somewhere along the line I've corrupted my repo by using incompatible
versions of the git/Cogito toolset.

I've noticed if I do a fresh cg-clone the problem seems to go away.

Be well,
Zack
