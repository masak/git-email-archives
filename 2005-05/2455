Are you accurately accounting for the cost of the extra hard/soft links 
your scheme requires?  Ie the directories get larger, lookups take 
slightly longer, etc.  Also access to a given file takes longer, and the 
deltas are referring to *other* packed files which *also* take longer to 
decompress and access...

How much better does delta-fication do, compared to just packing?
