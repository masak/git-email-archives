Hi Petr,

when doing a cg-update and I have local uncommitted changes it fails
with the "... needs update" message. From some previous posts on the
mailing list I got the impression that it is possible to pull updates
into the local repository with changed files. At the moment I am using
the following sequence:

	cg-diff > patch
	cg-cancel
	cg-update origin
	cat patch | patch -p1
	rm patch

The problem with this sequence is when I have added or removed files
from my repository. This needs a lot of manual fixing.

With Bitkeeper it was possible to pull changes as long as they don't
affect local uncommitted files.

Any ideas on how to implement or if it exists on how to use it?

Regards

Marcel
