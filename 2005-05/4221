Dear diary, on Mon, May 30, 2005 at 03:56:50AM CEST, I got a letter

It is nice, but actually losing information for me. It's ok for the HTTP
and SSH "smart pulls", but if I pull over rsync, I have progress
indication based on the first two digits - assuming roughly even
distribution of hashes, I can see that when I cross 80/ I'm in the half
etc. So what about showing some percentage or something in that case?
