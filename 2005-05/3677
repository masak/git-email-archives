I love how I can just say "oh, keep in mind that we might want to.." and 
24 hours later you did it.

Applied and pushed out, and I enjoyed seeing the output of 

	git-whatchanged -C

and doing a "/^copy" that shows it figuring out (correctly) that 
git-resolve-script was based on git-pull-script. Very cool.

I'm also somewhat surprised by the fact that it even seems to be usable on
the kernel tree:

	diff --git a/include/asm-um/archparam-i386.h b/include/asm-um/elf-i386.h
	similarity index 89%
	copy from include/asm-um/archparam-i386.h
	copy to include/asm-um/elf-i386.h
	--- a/include/asm-um/archparam-i386.h
	+++ b/include/asm-um/elf-i386.h
	...

cool.
