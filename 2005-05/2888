Dear diary, on Mon, May 09, 2005 at 08:01:25PM CEST, I got a letter
where Juliusz Chroboczek <Juliusz.Chroboczek@pps.jussieu.fr> told me that...

FWIW, Cogito does not lock at all yet - this is one of the things which
should be fixed soon.

See the Brad Robert's patches of Apr 21. I've decided not to apply them
since it appears a lot has changed since then and it would be some pain;
but they may be a worthy starting point for a more up-to-date patch.
