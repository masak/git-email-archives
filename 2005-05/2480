A rename will overwrite any old object, which means that you cannot do any 
collision checks. In contrast, a "link()" will return EEXIST if somebody 
else raced with you and created a new object, and you can do collision 
checks instead of overwriting another persons object.

Me, I refuse to slow down my habits for old filesystems. You can either 
fsck, or use a logging filesystem. 

I don't see anybody not using logging filesystems these days, so..

Maybe. Much less important, though.

It is all common code, except:
 - things like "fetch from another host" will use rsync/wget/xxx to 
   actually get the files. To those programs, we're not talking about git 
   objects, we're just talking "regular files"
 - rpull.c has a special different routine to write its objects. I don't 
   use it, so..

Anyway, it should be reasonably easily fixable.
