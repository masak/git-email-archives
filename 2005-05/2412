Before you get too far with the SSH version, I have some protocol changes
which (1) allow transmission of things other than objects; (2) allow the
pushing side to report that it doesn't have something without killing the
connection; (3) send refs. (1) and (2) are needed to make the protocol
extensible; (3) takes advantage of (1) to make it possible to maintain a
remote repository without doing anything other than rpush to it.

This goes with my patches from the weekend to enable git-*-pull to
transfer refs/ files in the same process.

Probably not rpull, which requires a login, at least not unless the others
fail. I think that http-pull is going to be nicer in the long run than
rsync, since the remote repository could have a bunch of mingled heads
and http-pull will get exclusively the interesting stuff. If you're trying
to push, then rpush, since that's the only push.

Personally, I've been using http://... for http-pull, rsync://... for
rsync, and //... for rpull/rpush (which is somewhat justified wrt the URI
standard for using the program's default method).
