I don't think I mind any more.

My initial reluctance to do this was based on the fact that I wanted to 
avoid having something that updates things "both ways" (ie updates both 
the index file _and_ the checked-out stuff), and the largest reason for 
that was just worrying about stability.

However, it's not like we've been having major stability issues, afaik, 
and as long as the index file locking is honoured (which the patch seemed 
to do), I don't have any real issues with it.
