I used the latest cg-update on a test repository and now it works, but I
found odd cases when I have files added/deleted that are not committed
yet. For the added case I saw this:

Warning: uncommitted local changes, trying to bring them forward
The next patch would create the file test.c,
which already exists!  Skipping patch.
1 out of 1 hunk ignored -- saving rejects to file test.c.rej
Adding file test.c

I also think that it would be great if we cancel the merge if the local
changes conflict with the files in the merge. This is how Bitkeeper does
it and I think it is the only safe way, because if something fails or
rejects we may destroy the local changes.

Regards

Marcel
