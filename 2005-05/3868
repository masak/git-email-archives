CVS has so many warts, that people can't even be bothered to fix things
like this. It's file-based, and that's that.

Using "-z 1" with cvsps doesn't seem to work well for me, but "-z 5" seems
ok, and together with the new git that allows .cvsignore, it doesn't
generate any warnings, nor any unreachable blobs. It does generate 300 new
changesets, and how many of those are required, I dunno. Clearly 102 of
them were, to disambiguate those changelog things.

Maybe "-z 10" would have generated a better thing with fewer changes yet
still unique changesets without dup files.

That's a bit irritating, that there's this magic tweakable that generates
different trees. Oh, well.

Anyway, what worries me more is that cvsps might have re-ordered other 
changesets than just the first two. It probably doesn't _matter_, but 
still...
