Dear diary, on Sun, May 15, 2005 at 11:19:50PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...
> Adds an newline between each diff.  Also change "#mode : "
> string, which was misleading in that we are not showing just

So, I've been looking at the output, and I have to admit that I'm still
not too happy with it (I know I'm horrible). It turned out to be rather
confusing, since there are normally no blank lines in the middle of the
diffs, so it looked as the blank lines were actually part of the diffed
files.

What about just throwing away the newlines and just passing '@.'?
