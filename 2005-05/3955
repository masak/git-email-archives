Dear diary, on Sun, May 22, 2005 at 09:11:06AM CEST, I got a letter

Well, and what if the commit has multiple parents? Or - even much more
interestingly - multiple children?

If we keep applying the first parent rule, we could just traverse the
graph from heads/master to HEAD following this rule, and then just take
a step back to where we came from for cg-seek +. It wouldn't be exactly
cheap, but it'd probably work.

Patch welcomed. ;-)
