Hmm.. You're right, but it feels kind of wrong. Clearly we support
removals in diff-files, but you're right, we can never have something show
up as an addition, since we only ever compare against files that are
already mentioned in the cache.

On the other hand, a unmerged entry really _could_ be a new file, could it 
not? Even if we right now always report it as "Unmerged path"? If it's a 
case of existing in stage 2/3 only, it really should show up as a new file 
diff for git-diff-files, no?

Or am I just being confused and/or stupid?
