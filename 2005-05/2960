I did consider wrapping it - I really did. But after thinking about it
for a couple of weeks
I eventually came to the conclusion it would be a sub-optimal solution.

And I don't agree that the structure is volatile. The actual structure
of GIT repository has been rock-solid since Linus reversed the
compression-signature order. Yes, there has been the excellent delta
work that Nicholas has been working on, but a Java version doesn't
need to use that anymore than Linus himself does [ and last time I
checked (the mailing list), Linus was being rather conservative about
that ].

What _has_ been changing at a great rate recently is the behaviour of
the tooling layer.

So, if I want a stable foundation to build my stuff on, basing it on
the output of the C tools would be a huge mistake. No, I think it
would be far safer for me to build my tooling using assumptions that
have proven to be rock-solid over the last few weeks - the structure
of the GIT repository format itself.

David, I have nothing whatsoever to do with the Eclipse implementation
of SSH, so what exactly is your point? All Java programmers are
fundamentally brain-damaged? Grow up, please.
