Maybe you have missed the point, where one Committer holds more than one
repository. See davem/net-2.6 and davem/sparc-2.6. Not to talk of
Russell King's and Greg's multiple repositories.
The Author is irrelevant, because one Author sends patches to more than
one maintainer. Author _cannot_ be a source of tracking information. If
you want to do heuristic guesses on Author/Committer pairs, then you
make the situation more complex than it is already.

As I said before it is completely irrelevant whether fast forward was
pulled into C directly from A or from B. 

Whats the relevant content of getting the same thing from A or B ? 

If you want to do this, you break the fast forward mechanism and
reinvent the pull ping-pong which is avoided by the fast forwards.
