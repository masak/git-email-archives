I appreciate the credit, but that is probably not needed in this
case, since this is quite commonly used pattern.  I've seen many
people do just this:

          command | ${PAGER:-less}

And if you think about it, you would realize that the above is
good enough, and probably is a lot better than what you are
doing.

Your PAGER shell function gives "-R" indiscriminately when
$PAGER_FLAGS is not set (or set to empty, which is even worse
because you are not giving the user to override this _bad_
choice) without even checking if the $PAGER is something that
understands "-R" (namely, "less").  I do not think users with
their PAGER set to "more" or "cat" (I do the latter when I am
working in Emacs) would appreciate that behaviour.

On the other hand, if your user is a "less" user, and if the
user wants it to honor ANSI "color" escape sequences, it would
be more helpful to the user if you educate/encourage the user to
have "LESS=R" in the environment and make that in effect
everywhere less is used not just in Cogito.  Giving that support
silently just in Cogito at the first thought may seem to be more
helpful but in reality it is not.

So I would suggest to use the above form without defining your
own PAGER shell function, and add a tip for "less" users to have
"LESS=R" in their environment somewhere in the documentation.
