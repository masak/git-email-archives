Hello!

Since cg-X* scripts are not supposed to be used by the end users, I
suggest that we rename them so something not starting with "cg-" or even
"cg" so that tab completion in bash doesn't show them.  I suggest "_cgX"
instead of "cg-X"

In the long term, the internal scripts should go to
$prefix/share/cogito, but it would require generating other scripts from
templates to substitute $prefix, which could be inconvenient at this
stage.
