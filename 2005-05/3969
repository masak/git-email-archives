I'd appreciate it if you take these two patches I sent last
night.

    * Add git-external-diff-script

    This is a demonstration of GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF mechanism, and a
    testbed for tweaking and enhancing what the built-in diff should
    be.  This script is designed to output exactly the same output
    as the built-in diff driver produces when set as GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF.

    * Diff updates.

    With the introduction of 'T', and the "apply-patch" Linus has
    been quietly working on without much advertisement, it started
    to make sense to emit usable information in the "diff --git"
    patch output format.  Earlier built-in diff driver punted and
    did not say anything about a symbolic link changing into a file
    or vice versa, but this version represents that as a pair of
    deletion and creation.

After that, you can experiment to flush out issues with the
current built-in using git-external-diff-script for quick
turnaround.  When you have a concrete "ok this is good" format
we can port that to C in diff.c:builtin_diff().
