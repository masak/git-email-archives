Umm.

I would much prefer a _much_ simpler fix at least for the pathname part,
which is to just always require that pathspec handling is done _first_.

Why? Because that's fundamentally how git-diff-tree has to work, and it's
how my mental model has always been: the path limitations are a
first-order filter, and if you give a directory, the end result should
always look exactly as if that directory was a project of its own.

In other words, if you limit yourself to a directory, and there was a
rename that moved a file from outside that directory into it, then it is
not a rename at all, it is a "create". The stuff outside the pathspec
limit simply doesn't exist.

This is fundamentally how git-diff-tree has to work for pathspec to make
any sense at all, and it's also the only usage that makes any sense (ie
when I say "git-whatchanged -p arch/i386 include/asm-i386", I expect that
the patches that show up _only_ concern themselves with what happened in
x86, and there's no cross-pollination with other stuff at all, even if
rename detection is enabled).

That in turn implies that the other pathspec users have to work the same
way, for the thing to be consistent.

Now, I don't know how you want pickaxe to work, and maybe you want that to 
run _after_ rename detection, I dunno. So I suspect you still want to do 
what this patch does, but I really don't want pathspec to be involved in 
this thing..
