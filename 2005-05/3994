The directory-based pathname pruning doesn't work any more.

I used to just say

	git-whatchanged -v -p drivers/usb/

and I just noticed that it doesn't work any more.

It _does_ work if I leave the final '/' off the thing.

diff-tree itself does this right: that's shown by the fact that with the
slash in place, we still do get the right _changelog_ that is restricted
to drivers/usb changes, but the diffs themselves are missing.

So it seems to be purely "diffcore_pathspec()" that is broken.

Btw, I don't think we should call "diffcore_pathspec()" at all in
diff-tree, because diff-tree already handles "interesting" paths correctly
(and has to do so for performance reasons, since it's not acceptable to
expand all the trees and diff them).

So in the "git-whatchanged"  case the fix is as simple as just removing
those two lines, but the bug then continues to exist in the other *diff* 
programs..

Junio?
