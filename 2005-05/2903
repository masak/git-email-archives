I think most things are using the O_CREAT | O_EXCL write to a file and
then rename or link/unlink to the desired location. I have some code to do
this with refs/*/* as well, and I think people have generally settled on
symlinking HEAD to something in refs/heads/. So it shouldn't be necessary
to lock the whole repository, unless you're doing some operation like
swapping two heads.

Should be trivial to fix.

I've got some patches to make new functions of the write_sha1_file sort
easier to write cleanly (for making git-*-pull clean); it wouldn't be too
hard to have an open/write/close set.

I'm working on making this cleaner. Are you wanting to write a tree from
something other than a cache?

I can post my patches, but Linus is on vacation, so they couldn't go into
the mainline until Friday or so anyway.
