No, that's not what I mean.

Suppose a large source file that may change only one line between two 
versions.  The delta may therefore end up being only a few bytes long.  
Compressing a few bytes with zlib creates a _larger_ file than the 
original few bytes.

Sure.  That's why I added the -d switch to mkdelta.  But if you can fit 
a delta which is 75% the size of its original object size then you still 
save 25% of the space, regardless of the delta chain length.

That's why multiple combinations should be tried.  And to keep things 
under control then a new argument specifying the delta "distance" might 
limit the number of trials.

In fact it seems that deltas might be significantly harder to compress.  
Therefore a test on the resulting file should probably be done as well 
to make sure we don't end up with a delta larger than the original 
object.

Not at all.  Nothing prevents you from making the latest revision of a 
file be the reference object and the previous revision turned into a 
delta against that latest revision, even if it was itself a reference 
object before.  The only thing that must be avoided is a delta loop and 
current mkdelta code takes care of that already.
