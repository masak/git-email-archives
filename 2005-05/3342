They aren't designed for the immediate users; they're implemented for the
immediate users. Feel free to add more fields as you need them. The
current selection is based on only adding things when there's a user for
them.

Existance is the primary thing, and everything else was added as
needed. (Pure connectivity is a bit special, because it's a property of
generic objects so that fsck-cache doesn't need to know about particular
types of objects unless there are particular things to check about them)

If you need more fields, let me know, and I'll figure out how to include
them.
