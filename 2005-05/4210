I actually like -B, it's just that that patch depended on -O and also came 
with a separate patch that was the reason I liked -B in the first place..

IO, if we have

	/* start out with files "a" and "b" */
	mv b c
	mv a b
	git-update-cache --add --remove a b c
	git-diff-cache -B HEAD

then I htink you're 100% right that it should show up as two renames in
a diffs, and "-B" would catch it. I think that's a great thing.
