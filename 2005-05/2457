I've got cg-admin-lsobj running (effectively find .git -type f | xargs 
cat-file), it is taking a looong time but the ratios seem to stay pretty 
constant as it makes progress:

total: 186863
blob: 93688     (6.6 per commit)
commit: 14172
tree: 79003      (5.5 per commit)

The packed item patch wouldn't duplicate info in this case.  When it initially 
creates the packed buffer (before compression), it checks for an existing 
file with the same sha1 and returns if one is found.  This is to preserve the 
optimizations for write_tree case where it frequently tries to create files 
that already exist.
