Yes, that would work. 

However, I ended up just validating the name parsing by making sure that 
when I parse the "git --diff" line, I only take the name if I can see it 
being the same for both the old and the new. IOW, if I see

	diff --git a/hi b/hello

then I won't take it, but if I see

	diff --git hi there/I am/being difficult   oopsie dir/I am/being difficult

then I get "I am/being difficult" by virtue of checking the two names 
against each other.

This means, btw, that the "git --diff" format must _not_ do

	diff --git a/file /dev/null
	deleted file mode 100644

because in that case I don't trust the filename enough. Of course, this
all only happens when deleting empty files, if the file had any contents,
then I will see the unambiguos filename on the '---' line, and again be
happy.

IOW, git-apply is being pretty anal about things, but it looks like that
works out well.
