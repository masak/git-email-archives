| Btw, here's my test of every single email in my email archive (which is 
| not that big any more - after the SCO subpoena, I decided that I never 
| want to go through with that kind of crap ever again, so now it's only a 
| month or two of things). 
| 
| Almost everything seems to follow the RFC's or at least be close enough
| that my "accept anything" ends up doing something sane, except for three
| emails:
| 
| 	Date: Fri, 08 Apr 2005 02:20:10 0200 -> bad
| 	Date: Mon, 18 Apr 05 15:05:29 Hora oficial do Brasil -> bad
| 	Date: 2002/04/11 18:29:07 -> bad
| 
| That first one doesn't have a sign in front of the timezone (I'll fix
| things up - right now I end up believing that it's "year 200"), and the
| third one has the sane European date order that sorts nicely (and which
| I'll also fix up).

Third one is almost ISO 8601 standard date format, except that
ISO uses hyphens, e.g., 2002-04-11, so I hope that the
punctation is a little flexible...

| The second one is funny. Not just the "Hora oficial do Brasil" (hey, I 
| could add it as a real timezone and my parser would do the right thing ;) 
| but also because my parser decides that "05" is not a year, but the day in 
| the month, so it doesn't see the year.
| 
| I can fake out that year thing pretty easily ("if it starts with '0' it's 
| not a day of the month"), but it does show just how _strange_ stuff 
| there's out there.
| 
| ("Hora" is also Swedish for "whore", so that timezone does end up being
| mentally parsed _quite_ the wrong way for somebody like me who doesn't
| speak spanish).
