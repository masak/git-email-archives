Since pretty much all the blobs will be expanded in the working directory
anyway, it sounds like that would be the way to go.

You can actually get the blob size fairly easily for non-delta objects, by 
just unpacking the beginning of it. But since we have the files..

That said, I don't think -C is that important. I personally don't see it
as a thing I'd run normally - it's more of a thing I might do between
releases rather than for something like git-whatchanged that looks at
every commit. It's an interesting thing to have _available_, but I don't
think it's a huge problem if it is a lot more expensive than the more
normal "-M".
