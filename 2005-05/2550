That would actually make sense; commits would go all the way
back to the "empty tree" as the ultimate initial tree.

There's an interesting side-effect of this; I _think_ it's
fine but it might be worth thinking through. If all
new projects start with an empty tree, that creates a
"common root" that all projects can appeal to.
That means that in theory a merge between any two project root
trees can eventually find a common ancestor: the empty tree.
I _think_ that's okay... is it?

That also means that empty directories will end up with the
"empty tree" as well.  Is there a risk of multiple empty directories
causing problems later?  As far as I can tell, there aren't
any problems with that, and does seem logically sound.
