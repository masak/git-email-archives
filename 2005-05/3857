Hello,

yes, it is. ;-)

Nice! :-)

btw:

For the mutt tree there are a few 'empty commits' eg were the
parent tree is the same as the current. This is because git ignores
.cvsignore and they commited some .cvsignore files without any other
deltas. I don't know if you want to handle this. Just a note.

Yes, it is, I had that problem before. For example tlr commtis the
changelog seperate with '# changlog' or so log message and cvsps thinks
because of the 'time fuzz which defaults to a way to high value' that
three changelog commits are all one delta. And that it adds three
entries. And what annoys me most in the wrong direction. So if you would
apply them as patches they don't apply because of the wrong ordering.

Reference:
		PatchSet 3005
		Date: 2002/12/07 19:19:42
		Author: roessler
		Branch: HEAD
		Tag: (none)
		Log:
		# changelog commit

		Members:
			ChangeLog:3.7->3.8
			ChangeLog:3.6->3.7
			ChangeLog:3.5->3.6

Just call cvsps with -z "20" for the mutt repository also -z 1 should
work because the timestamps of one 'commit' are all set to the same
value.
