But you can't add additional information to the fast-forward head. That
would defeat the whole point of the fast-forward.

Not random order, those changes were performed in parallel, so there is
no order between them until they are merged, at which point the parent
linkage defines the order. If you want to add a total ordering to them,
write out a file with 'commit-id parent-id' pairs and run it through
'tsort'.

Your examples break if you consider additional merges where M syncs up a
couple of times (f.i. at Rn-2) before M is merged back into R.

What you seem to want won't be fixed by adding a repoid, you need to
keep a list of all the commits you have already seen and append any new
ones whenever you look at the history. If you look whenever you pull or
merge the list will be in the total ordering that you seem to expect for
your repository. But that is a porcelain thing.
