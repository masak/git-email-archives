The tricky thing is that you want to *not* see commits where somebody
adopted somebody else's change to drivers/char/i8k.c; you want to ignore
those commits in favor of the commits where the original author of the
changes made the changes. Otherwise, you mostly see merges with people
submitting lines where they didn't change that file.
