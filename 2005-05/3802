Well, normally you'd not use the faw format, and the worst that can happen 
is likely that the pathnames in the diff are screwed up.

Side note: files with spaces/tabs in the names have serious problems in
diffs anyway, because parsing the name ends up becoming largely random at
that point. Sad. The problem there is that the format for filenames in
diffs is not very well-specified.

THAT is a much bigger problem than the raw diff format, since that 
actually ends up interfering with interoperability.

The same goes for broken DOS CR-NL text-files, btw. If anybody ever ports
git to the crap that is DOS/Windows (and I assume NT does it too), they'll
have endless problems with interoperating with sane systems.
