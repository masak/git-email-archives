Have you checked how many of those are blobs?

For many commits, we generate as many (or more) _tree_ objects as we 
generate blobs. 

And tree obejcts from the same "supertree" really is something that I
wouldn't mind packing some way, because they really tend to be very much
related (since they refer to each other). Eg the commit and the top-level
tree are almost always a pair, since you'd get a shared top-level tree
only with two commits that have the exact same content (which definitely
happens, don't get me wrong, but it we get some duplication for that case,
we'd still be winning).
