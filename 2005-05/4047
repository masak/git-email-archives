  git-ls-tree reporting just the tree's hash is valid, because if
you want everything in that tree, you can just do:

git-ls-tree `git-ls-tree HEAD path/dir | (read m t h n; echo $h)`

  I don't see the problem there.

The problem was that 't' and 't t' produced *vastly* different output
in the old code. 't' would emit everything in the tree, and 't t' would
only emit t's hash.
