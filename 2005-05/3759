Hello,

okay. I will doublecheck that and come back.

I added some debugging output (see attached patch) and saw that the
reason for the invalid thing is that the inode has changed:

...
name: pull.h 0x00000010
name: read-cache.c 0x00000010
...

#define INODE_CHANGED   0x0010

Same problem tla had. It looked at the device number. And of course the
device number for NFS shares isn't the same on all machines. So I
attached a little patch which fixes the issue for me (and others).

It is more like that I don't remember on which machine I worked last and
working accidently on my next free window in screen (and I have a lot of
windows). And getting 370 Mbyte over NFS hits my nerves. ;-)

I will not do that. And I will add locking for such operations in my frontend
anyway.

Here is the real patch:

[PATCH] Don't include devicenumber into INODE_CHANGED test

This fixes the problem that git-update-cache --refresh rebuilds the
cache stat information everytime it is started on a different host while
working in the same NFS shared repository.
