Ahh.. "diff-tree" uses the wrong algorithm for selecting name ordering.

It thinks that "DF" and "DF/" sort equally because it just looks at the
name, not the type. So then, becuse the names sort the same, it will sort
them according to where they come from, and you get the behaviour you see.

It doesn't really matter, but you're right, I should fix it to be
consistent.

git-diff-cache and git-diff-files should automaticallu get it right thanks
to reading the whole tree, so it's likely just git-diff-tree that can get 
confused.
