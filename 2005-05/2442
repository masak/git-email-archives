Actually, you can win quite a lot.

I've just been playing with storing the entire 
linux-2.4.0-to-2.6.12-rc2-patchset as xdelta patches in git. The entire 
thing ended up being 577M (instead of some 3.5G), according to du -sh 
--apparent-size. Considering that that's some 800M of patches, that's 
not too bad.

I used a very simple scheme: I stored a delta to the previous version of 
every file if that delta was less than 20% in size of the new file 
(otherwise, the whole file was stored as usual). If the previous version 
was already in delta form, the delta was computed from that versions 
"parent". I didn't even care to look at files less than 4k in size.

In other words, I didn't have to use any delta "chains", and still got 
quite massive storage size gains. And this scheme could easily be used 
on the fly; I'm guessing that it would be performance neutral (or even a 
slight gain, since less has to be compressed and written to disk on 
commits, and there might be less to read when diffing, since two 
"delta-blobs" might share the same parent).

Or, with careful tuning, a repo might be "deltaified" later on (assuming 
that delta blobs are addressed using the expanded files' hash).
