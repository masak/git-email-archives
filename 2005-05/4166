Dear diary, on Sun, May 29, 2005 at 08:04:44PM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...

(As long as you don't want to search for something else. ;-)

But yes, I like the less -p hack.

It's just something along the lines of "Me Og. Og sees /^+/. Og makes
the line green." written in gawk (actually I'm not sure if pure awk
wouldn't do, but I actually don't know the language), so I don't think
the external diff thing would've helped me with that in any way.
