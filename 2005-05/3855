Sounds possible.  Unfortunately, the 'uniqueness' of a commit actually 
doesn't exist.  It's all smoke-and-mirrors.  In order to disallow this 
(which I think need to do) I'd need to use some commit member 
information, and add some heuristic: if this file is already in the 
commit, then this MUST be a different commit.  Unfortunately, it's 
possible that the 'member' already in the commit is the wrong one and 
this is the right one, which just sounds horribly ugly to me.

I'll think on it.
