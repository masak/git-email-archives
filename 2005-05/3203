Dear diary, on Fri, May 13, 2005 at 02:15:15AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> told me that...
> Additional option, --stop-at=<commit>, is introduced.  The
> git-rev-list output stops just before showing the named commit.
> 
> This is based on Thoms Gleixner's patch but slightly reworked.

Won't apply for now - as I already said in the relevant thread, this
makes no sense with the current git-rev-list output order, and even
encourages using it in wrong way. It is ok when the merges are reported
in a different way, but that's impossible without some repoid (I yet
have to catch up with that thread :-).
