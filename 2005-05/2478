how is this better than a single rename?  i take it there is something
fundamental from clue.101 i slept though here?

also, if you are *really* paranoid you want to fsync *before* you do
the link/unklink or rename --- which is what MTAs do[1]

however, that said it *kills* performance and if it's not critical
it's really a terrible idea

also, shouldn't HEAD (and similar)[2] be updated with a temporary and
a rename too?

cool

i thought this was all common code?  if it's not maybe now is the time
to change that?



[1] yes, i know this depends on the fs used and various things and
    ext3 should be fine, blah blah blah, but not everyone uses ext3
    and quite probably not everyone will use git under Linux

[2] i didn't check the code as i'm still using BK in places
