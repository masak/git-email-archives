Hi !

So it's my understanding that linus only uses this HEAD that symlinks
to .git/refs/heads/master as his head of tree.

However, when using cogito, it creates another one here called "origin"
that matches the "origin" branch (I don't like "branch" here, it's more
like a source of objects than a branch...) locally. Is this actually the
content of the remote's HEAD or is git also looking for a remote
"refs/heads/origin" ?

So when I later do cg-pull or cg-update origin to update, my "origin"
pointer is updated I suppose to the new head of the remote repository,
does it also update my local "refs/heads/master" ? Or not ? What happens
to it ? does anything will use my local HEAD -> refs/heads/master/
ever ? If I want to publish my tree, what will remote cogito's try to
rsync down ? HEAD ? origin ?

Ben.
