I think we are in agreement and saying the same thing.  Yes, if
people wants to do mix and match, they should know what they are
doing.

Also I do not see any reason not to have GIT that comes from
Cogito additional stuff while Linus tree lags behind, which in a
sense already has been the case for some commands.  Separating
directories would make things easier to manage, not harder.

Anyhow let's wait and see what Petr does.  He said he has been
preparing core backports earlier.  No point arguing about his
tree without helping him.
