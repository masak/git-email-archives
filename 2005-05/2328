I was intending this to be a more general concensus (and you seem to have
followed it with your "snap" subdirectory).

Actually, my code was intended to take things like "heads/master" or
"tags/linux-2.6.13", which are found under "refs/" (although I also check
that they don't start with "." and have exactly one "/", to enforce the
naming system). Making it "heads/linus" rather than "linus" is important
for writing the files, since you can't guess reliably what subdirectory
the user means; also, it is easier for dealing with HTTP servers, where
you don't know what to ask for.
