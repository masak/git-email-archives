I think I described it with too many cases above. parse_*() doesn't change
whether the contents are unpacked. The obvious optimization is performed 
if possible.

I'm already going to add a per-type global to have the parse functions
also unpack the object contents user-visibly, for the case that Junio
pointed out. (Making it: parse_* doesn't change whether the contents are
unpacked, unless you tell it to unpack objects.)

I think the only likely bug would be unpacking objects after parsing
them, instead of before, which is correct but inefficient. It should be
clear to a user whether the raw contents are available at any point in the
user code.
