I really hate magic interfaces like that. It's just a bug waiting to 
happen.

I'd actually prefer it if "parse_object()" just always unpacks it, and 
leaves the unpacked thing in memory. 

Then, the _few_ programs that really care about memory use because they
parse potentially millions of objects (especially blobs, which obviously
can be very large) can be updated to just do a manual
"free_object_contents()". That's primarily things like fsck and
convert-cache, I suspect.

That would leave a lot less special cases and strange rules..
