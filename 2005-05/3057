Why would anyone care how many repositories Russell or Greg use?  Why does
anyone care if Dave used his repo A, B, or C?   Aren't I still just going
to contact him via his author email addy if I have an issue with an object
he has added to the stream?

And if I do care which repo he used, why don't I care about the case i've
outlined where the chain of command information is lost?

Exactly!!!  So what is relevant of getting the same thing from Dave's A or
B?  The only point would be to show chain of command, but you don't seem
interested in that.

Yes, I think there are other ways to avoid the ping pong too.
