I considered it, but it's not worth it.

If you don't want somebody else to see your objects, you should just 
disable execute permission on your .git directory. "umask" is actually a 
fairly nasty interface, since it takes effect on create(), and we do want 
to fchmod _after_ the create (some filesystems don't like it when you 
create a non-writable object and then write to it, but more importantly, 
since we use "mkstemp()" for the temp-file handling, we don't even have 
control of the initial umask.

So to make it (0444 & umask) git would actually have to jump through silly
hoops. Without actually buying you anything new, since the access
permissions for git objects really are about the _directory_ anyway.
