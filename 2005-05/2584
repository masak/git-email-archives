Yep.  And compression can be improved without changing de decompressor 
since the decompressor is only a replay of what the compressor found to 
be redundent.  That redundency searching can probably be improved wrt to 
the current code.  And FRankly considering about 300 lines of code to 
create a delta and 60 lines to expand it is hard to beat maintenance 
wise.

Indeed.
