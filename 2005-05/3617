What I ended up doing for the diff viewer on kernel.org is that every 
page that's generated gets stuffed in a cache (locklessly indexed by a 
SHA-1 of a canonicalized form of the query); the pages people actually 
see are then simply pulled from the cache.  This caching was a just 
enormous win.  In the case of the diff viewer, the header is generated 
each time, since I allow the user to select a custom style sheet (and 
don't want to cache versions for each style sheet), but that's a trivial 
detail.
