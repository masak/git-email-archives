Linus, xdelta-based algorithms already stores informations regarding the 
object that originated the diff. Since they have no context (like 
text-based diffs) and are simply based on offset-driven copy/insert 
operations, this is a requirement. Libxdiff uses an adler32+size of the 
original object, but you can get as fancy as you like in your own 
implementation. Before a delta patching, the stored information are cross 
checked with the input base object, and the delta patch will fail in the 
eventuality of mismatch. So an fsck is simply a walk backward (or forward, 
depending on your metadata model) of the whole delta chain.
