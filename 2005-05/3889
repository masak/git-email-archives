My prior programming experience has taught me to read argv > 1 as an
assertion about argv, as opposed to 1 < argv, which would be an assertion
about 1.  In other words, as I code, I'm generally thinking about testing
a variable against some sort of boundary condition (which may or may not
be itself variable), and the thing that I'm testing goes first, followed
by the test.  As a result, 1 < argv throws me for a moment, since on first
read it seems to imply the programmer was expecting the value of 1 to
change.
