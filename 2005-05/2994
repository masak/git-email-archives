  Hello,

  I would be very happy if you could extend the gitweb scripts a little.
Basically, what I need is to have ability to create a permanent link to
a given file in the repository, which stays same across revisions (as
long as the file stays with the given name, obviously).

  E.g. I would like to have something like

	http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=cogito%2Fcogito.git;n=contrib/ciabot.pl

for file contrib/ciabot.pl in the latest Cogito tree, and

	http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=cogito%2Fcogito.git;n=contrib

for the list of the contrib/ directory in the latest Cogito tree.

  I think I would prefer the link from the repository index to go not to
the log page, but some "summary" page, which would have some short
information about the repository (owner, description, list of branches
if gitweb supports that, list of tags, link to the latest tree and link
to the log).

  BTW, why are people using ';' in the URIs for separators instead of
good old '&'s? Hmm, actually it just occurred to me that it might be to
workaround entity string problems?

  Thanks,
