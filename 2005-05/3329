	I don't understand what was wrong with Jeff Garzik's previous
suggestion of using http/1.1 pipelining to coalesce the round trips.
If you're worried about queuing too many http/1.1 requests, the client
could adopt a policy of not having more than a certain number of
requests outstanding or perhaps even making a new http connection
after a certain number of requests to avoid starving other clients
when the number of clients doing one of these transfers exceeds the
number of threads that the http server uses.

	Being able to do without a server side CGI script might
encourage deployment a bit more, both for security reasons and
effort of deployment.

	In any case, using httpd or ftp makes it easier to deploy
servers in cases where it might be harder to modify firewall rules,
so I am glad to see that, even if it is through a CGI script.
