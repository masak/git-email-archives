Dear diary, on Fri, May 13, 2005 at 11:05:34AM CEST, I got a letter
where Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org> told me that...

Uhm, I know. :-) It sorta evolved like that. We didn't yet settle down
on where to actually put the functions. I'd say right after . cg-Xlib.

Yes, by all means. On one side I like the colon notation, on the other
side this was always my biggest usability problem with SVN. And it costs
us nothing and does what the user would after all expect, I think.
