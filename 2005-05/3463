Cool!

My goal is to provide the mechanism that can be used by a higher level 
implementing the deltafication policy.  I only provided one script as an 
example, but it turns out that you found a way to achieve better space 
saving.  And I bet you that there is probably ways to do even better 
with more exhaustive delta targets.  For example you could try all 
possible combinations on an object list for each file (and let it run 
overnight).

> 1) Too many deltas get too big and/or compress badly.

One thing I've been wondering about is whether gzipping small deltas is 
actually a gain.  For very small files it seems that gzip is adding more 
overhead making the compressed file actually larger.  Might be worth 
storing some deltas uncompressed if the compressed version turns out to 
be larger.

> 2) Trees take up a big chunk of total space.

Tree objects can be deltafied as well, but I didn't had time to script 
it.  A large space saving can be expected there as well, especially for 
changesets that modify only a few files deep down the tree hierarchy.

Well, any delta object smaller than its original object saves space, 
even if it's 75% of the original size. But...

... but then the ultimate solution is to try out all possible references 
within a given list.  My git-deltafy-script already finds out the list 
of objects belonging to the same file.  Maybe git-mkdelta should try 
all combinations between them.  This way a deeper delta chain could be 
allowed for maximum space saving.

Yup.

I will look at it and merge the good stuff.

Thanks for testing!
