Embedded spaces in path is _always_ safe.  And I think with the
current code unless you are using rename detection, your path
with embedded TABs are also OK (but do not depend on it).

If you are using rename detetion, your rename source path is
truncated at the first TAB and your rename destination path has
the remainder of the source path, with an extra TAB, prepended
to it.  Nothing as far as I know would detect and warn that
situation.  If you have an embedded LF, then you are SOL,
period.  Just do not do it.

I _could_ add a code to diff-helper to barf if your path have an
embedded TAB in it, but I am not sure if that is worth it.  Also
I _could_ add a code to diff-raw output routine to barf if your
path have these problematic characters in it and you are not
using '-z'.  I think the latter makes quite a lot of sense.

The design comes from this reasoning (third point of "a few
results"); please look in your archive if you care about the
details.
