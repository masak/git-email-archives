Dear diary, on Tue, May 03, 2005 at 02:10:42AM CEST, I got a letter
where Matt Porter <mporter@kernel.crashing.org> told me that...
> Adds a trivial per-repository exclude file implementation for
> cg-status on top of the new git-ls-files option.

Thanks, applied. I decided to go with this version instead of the
.git/info/exclude one since I *don't* think you want to share this. The
very fact it is in the .git/ directory implies here that these are your
local exclude patterns which are likely temporary and more importantly
you don't want them under version control. Therefore they aren't
really interesting for anyone else and should be kept per-tree. That's
this file's point as I view it. If you want something more persistent,
get it to git's sight.

The fact that we have no support for version-tracked exclude file can't
stop me! ;-)
