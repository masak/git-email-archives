Here is a revert you can apply after merging with the tip of my
tree if you wanted to.  As you pointed out correctly, three-way
read-tree would not produce the situation as I feared, and the
attempt to postprocess the result by git-merge-one-file-script
git-merge-cache calls would be caught with the changes we made
to git-update-cache, so there is no need for the extra check by
write-tree in that workflow example.  Sorry for being ultra
dense.

The only reason why I am holding off from pushing this out is
because I still cannot convince myself that we eradicated _all_
the possibile paths to create such nonsense in the index, and I
feel safer to keep the check this patch is reverting, at least
for now.

Revert the extra-careful check in write-tree.c

I am not particularly fond of reverting this, but with the
git-update-cache changes it is unlikely that we will have file
vs directory conflicts in the index anymore, so there may be no
point in being extra careful when writing the tree out.
