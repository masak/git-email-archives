This is just a cover letter but the next patch implements the
rename detection I told you about.

The output from the patched version is attached at the end of
this message as a demonstration.

My plan is to get the documentation and the framework in place
with this patch first.  The basic strategy is to hold created
and deleted files while we parse the incoming diff-tree output,
and match them up at the end, looking for usefully similar pair.

The similarity evaluator included in this round of patch detects
exact renames only, which is not very useful in practice, but
that would be improved in the later round.  It will probably be
done with the same deltify code Nico is using.
