I checked in the fixed arg parsing already ;)

Hmm. According to that logic, ">" and ">=" is superfluous.

Also, what language do you actually speak? Every human language I know
(admittedly, apart from Finnish they are all related) tends to say things
like "if you have more than four children, you're in trouble", rather than
saying "if four is less than the number of children you have".

Notice? People compare something _to_ a number. They don't compare a
number to something. We say "if more than four", we don't say "if four is
less".

Sadly, I can't get google to match "1 < x" and "x > 1" (it just considers
all special characters to be basically whitespace, so "1 < x" matches "1
x" and "1.x" according to google. Usually google is a good way to get a
feel for how common some phrase is, but not on things like this.
