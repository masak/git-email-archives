Yes, I'll occasionally do patches which were written by "A" as:

From: A
...
Signed-off-by: B

And that comes through email as:


...
From: <akpm@osdl.org>
...
From: A
...
Signed-off-by: B


which means that the algorithm for identifying the author is "the final
From:".

I guess the bug here is the use of From: to identify the primary author,
because transporting the patch via email adds ambiguity.

Maybe we should introduce "^Author:"?
