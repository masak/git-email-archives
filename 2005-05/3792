Btw, putting the "what happened" into the fixed-format stuff before the
filenames allows you to have more thana fixed number of filenames even in
the machine-readable format. For example, it would allow the
machine-readable format to have just a single NUL character at the end of
the line for the "modified" case, since now it's unambigious where the
line ends (thanks to the fact that "M" always has only one file).

Similarly, it allows us to later add a "combine" reason (take two files, 
combine them into a third), which needs three filenames. That would 
becomes very messy if the "reason" part is after the filenames, because it 
gets easily ambigious.
