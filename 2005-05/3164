Dear diary, on Thu, May 12, 2005 at 03:58:10PM CEST, I got a letter
where Alexey Nezhdanov <snake@penza-gsm.ru> told me that...
> All git and cogito scripts wants .git subdirectory. If I'm in a subdirectory

This is fine for Cogito, but Git itself shouldn't care - unless you mean
the bundled mini-plumbing scripts. I don't know if anyone (and who) uses
them except Linus, but I'm not likely to make much effort to maintain
them, or even to actually accept any non-trivial changes to them.

Cogito really needs it.

Add it to cg-Xlib. You can just update $_git appropriately. (Except when
you were explicitly passed GIT_DIR.)

I would gradually trim the $curpath by $(dirname) until I hit
$curpath/.git or the root directory.
