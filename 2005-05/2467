If you use a "full tip" metadata format with reverse deltas, you drop a 
"full" version "time to time" along the chain, and you keep a small index 
file, you have:

1) No matter how big it becomes the xdelta collection object, you are only 
   touching very limited regions of it (due the small index file, that can 
   be less than 20+8 bytes per entry in the xdelta blob)

2) Checkout happens w/out even doing xpatching (since the tip is full)

3) Checkins requires only one xdelta operation (since the tip is full), 
   and zero if it is the time to store a full version along the chain (I 
   use to drop one every 10-16 xdeltas, depending on the progressive size 
   of the delta operations)

4) Worst case performance in reconstructing histories are bound by the 
   longest xdelta chain (10-16)

In some way I tend to agree (strangely ;) with you about the disk-cheap 
mantra, but network bandwidth matter IMO. So, if you do not want (being a 
real worry-wart) to use xdelta leverage on the FS trees, you can have way 
smarter network protocols using xdelta plus the knowledge of the git 
history structure. The rsync algo uses xdelta, but the poor guy is not 
able to leverage from the knowledge of the history that only git knows. 
So, if Larry and Greg shares a common object A, Larry changes A and makes 
a new git object B, rsync will transfer the whole object B, because it 
does not have any idea of the git structure. Git though, has this 
knowledge, and it can say to the remote fetcher: Look, I have this new 
thing called B, that is basically your thing A plus this very small xdelta 
(B-A). And typical xdelta diffs are really small (1/7 to 1/10 of classical 
'diff -u' ones).
