The directory structure is definitely awkward. I'd personally put cogito
stuff in a separate directory. But that's a matter of which paths belong
to which commit.

But when Petr adds something to the core, intended for eventual inclusion
in the mainline, and uses it in cogito, this breaks everything, because
then people have to know to pull both the latest cogito and the latest git
from him. If the new git isn't backwards-compatible, then someone building
an old cogito would have to somehow find the matching old git.

This is far worse than just including git and sending Linus patches; the
only way to make this manageable would be to suspend cogito until git was
completely finished.

The important thing, I think, is being able to connect a Cogito with the
git it uses, while both are unstable and under active development. It
would be nice to be able to have the obvious things happen when you pull
the latest cogito and check it out, and when you commit with changes to
files from each of them, but that's less important.
