"An empty tree (no HEAD)"?  Is your definition of "an empty
tree" the same as "empty" directory after you do "mkdir empty &&
cd empty && git-init-db", followed by bunch of git-*-pull to get
the objects and commits from other reposititories being involved
in the merge but without touching .git/HEAD?  If so, why cannot
I do the git-*-pull from multiple repositories and merge them
together?  Why "there is only one head in this array that is
remote_head"?  Oh, I guess I am missing your definition of
"remote_head".  Puzzled...

Anyhow I presume that if your ${GIT-.git}/HEAD exists, you
include it as the first element of MERGE_HEADS.

Sorry I am not very good at this "thinking" thing, and I need to
draw pictures.  Please bear with me.

    (line of dev C)-------------C    We are here, trying to merge
    (line of dev B)---(merge)---B    these three lines of devs:
    (line of dev A)---A/             A, B and C

    MERGE_HEADS = (A B C)
    A is actually a "subset" of B

Is this what you mean by "subset"?  Are these "subset" HEAD the
only thing that causes fast forwards?

My gut feeling without thinking much is that it might be easier
to first cull such fast forward heads by using N-way rev-tree
before you do anything else.  If only one head survives after
that, then that head would be your new head and you do not have
to go through any merges.  Otherwise you merge those independent
heads without worrying about fast forwards.  How does that
sound?
