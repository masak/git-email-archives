It's true that you might not want to include all of the refs; but doesn't
it make more sense to support the standard arrangement of refs (i.e.,
they're in .git/refs/kind/name) for the ones you want to include, rather
than having to pull out the hex to pass in yourself?

Right; what I want to make programs able to do is take explicit
references, instead of only taking the objects they reference. So you say
heads/master or heads/linus instead of
"198b0fb635ed8a007bac0c16eab112c5e2c7995c".

The part that makes this important is that the user may be trying to look
up a reference on a remote machine using the same connection that the
objects will come over, and this is impractical without having the program
know how to handle reference files.

Agreed; which references to use are up to either the power user or the
script, not the core. I'm just interested in having a core implementation
for using them when specified.
