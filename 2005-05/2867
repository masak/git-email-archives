Hi,

I wrote a git repository tracker, which can track and coordinate
multiple git repositories. Before it goes public, I want to clarify a
problem which I encountered

The commit bfd4bda097f8758d28e632ff2035e25577f6b060 
by David Woodhouse (Thu May 5 12:59:37 2005 +100)  
Merge with
master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git 

breaks the history.

David merged from Linus repository . Linus synced later with David.
Linus did not create a new commit for this update and just pointed his
"HEAD" to Davids "HEAD", which means he forked Davids repository at this
point.

Due to that the parent->parent history is not longer unique. This makes
it impossible to do file revision graphs over the various repositories
in the correct order.

Is this a unique problem or is the omission of a commit in cases like
that usual practice ? In the latter case proper history tracking is
almost impossible.

tglx
