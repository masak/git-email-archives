That limits the usefulness to a local place, which makes no sense in a
distributed development scenario.

Right. That was my basic idea to collect the information either from an
environment variable or deduce it from the current wroking directory,
which is unlikely to be the same for different branches. hpa's arguments
against this approach are quite good but I think somethink like a per
branch repository id is not too hard to implement.
