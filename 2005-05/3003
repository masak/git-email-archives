Agreed - I am not proposing a change to the index format, merely
highlighting that the index format is closely bound to the
workspace-oriented toolset and that the workspace-oriented toolset is
distinct from the repository-oriented toolset; different
workspace-oriented toolsets will have different requirements for their
index files and so their index files might quite rightly differ in
both form and substance.

That said, their is no harm making my set of tools interoperable with
the git tools, where that is possible so that the user can decide to
use which ever toolset fits the job immediately at hand. With this in
mind, a published specification of the index format would help, but I
am not going insist on that. I am certainly not going to ask for
changes to it! Life is too short :-)
