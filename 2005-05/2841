Dear diary, on Mon, May 09, 2005 at 05:59:59AM CEST, I got a letter

I was already thinking about this and I think Sean's way makes more
sense. Also, I actually believe you should add this functionality to
commit-tree instead (commit-tree -n (dry-run), perhaps?) - so that the
user can actually check the default values commit-tree is going to use
too. *That* would be useful.

No, I think this sucks. You should just list the variables in cg-commit
documentation if anything. That's where they matter anyway and where the
user could possibly look for them anyway.

I think the command is otherwise pretty useless, and the important thing
is, the command slots are precious (well, there are free cg-admin slots
but I think this one does not qualify there neither) - have too many
useless (or barely useful) commands and you end up as GNU Arch. So I'm
willing to add commands only when I'm convinced they will really help
the user.
