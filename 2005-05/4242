Ok, I'm at the point where I really think it's getting close to a 1.0, and
make another tar-ball etc. I obviously feel that it's already way superior
to CVS, but I also realize that somebody who is used to CVS may not 
actually realize that very easily.

So before I do a 1.0 release, I want to write some stupid git tutorial for
a complete beginner that has only used CVS before, with a real example of
how to use raw git, and along those lines I actually want the thing to
show how to do something useful.

So before I do that, is there something people think is just too hard for
somebody coming from the CVS world to understand? I already realized that
the "git-write-tree" + "git-commit-tree" interfaces were just _too_ hard
to put into a sane tutorial.

I was showing off raw git to Steve Chamberlain yesterday, and showing it
to him made some things pretty obvious - one of them being that
"git-init-db" really needed to set up the initial refs etc). So I wrote
this silly "git-commit-script" to make it at least half-way palatable, but
what else do people feel is "too hard"?

I think I'll move the "cvs2git" script thing to git proper before the 1.0 
release (again, in order to have the tutorial able to show what to do if 
you already have an existing CVS tree), what else?
