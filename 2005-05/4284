Junio, 
 pathspec is still subtly broken.

Just removing the slash at the end is not the right thing to do, since 
that means that

	git-diff-files drivers/char/

will trigger on a _file_ "drivers/char", even though the spec makes it 
unambiguous that the user only wants to see stuff under that directory.

Again, git-diff-tree gets this right (not to say that it always did - I
had to fix "interesting()" several times, exactly because it's not that 
simple).
