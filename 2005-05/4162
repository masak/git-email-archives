I'm not sure I like this.

I actually _expect_ that "git-diff-files" will show files that don't match 
the index, even if they happen to have the exact content that the index 
points to. It's how I know whether the index is up-to-date or not.

The exact same thing is trye of git-diff-cache. If something isn't 
up-to-date in the cache, you should show it, since certain operations 
depend on the cache being updated.
