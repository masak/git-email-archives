Dear diary, on Sun, May 08, 2005 at 05:43:10PM CEST, I got a letter
where Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org> told me that...

Isn't one free character enough?  I'll just stay with 75. :-)

Not so. I frequently write a brief summary of what I'm actually merging.
I'm not forcing you to do so too, but I personally think it's a good
idea, and want to do it in the future too. :-)

It boosts the patch size unnecessarily. It shouldn't be called gitci2
anyway... :-) Feel free to change the mktemp templates instead.

The gitci name comes all the way from the times where this command was
usually triggered by 'git ci'.

This mess is still here.
