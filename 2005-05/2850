But, there are commits (even in your tree) that aren't produced by Cogito.
 And the current logic gets them wrong.

Look at commit:  211232bae64bcc60bbf5d1b5e5b2344c22ed767e in your tree.

The current logic will miss the fact that one of the other parents
altered, git-apply-patch-script.   Seems better to over report, than under
report changes, although I agree that some way must be found to handle the
merge case.
