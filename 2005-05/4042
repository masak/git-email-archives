I haven't read your code yet, but...

I presume the counterpart to this one in your "New Results"
example, which is spelled "git-ls-tree f" is a typo of
"git-ls-tree t", but if that is the case I strongly disagree.

What you really want is something similar to '-d' flag to
/bin/ls.  You are interested in the directory itself not its
contents and I think your gripe is that giving a path that
matches a tree always descends into it (i.e. there is no way to
do the equivalent of "/bin/ls -d t").  I agree that it is a
problem, but changing "/bin/ls t" not to show the directory
contents of "t" is not a solution.

JM> 	$ git-ls-tree t/
JM> 	(no output)

I agree with you that this is not what we want and we should
behave the same way as "git-ls-tree t" would in this case.

JM> 	$ git-ls-tree t t
JM> 	040000 tree 4eeb3990955b8badc4c14712b89d8cd9fff02f15    t

I do not know what you wanted to say in this example.  Your
"Old" and "New" look the same to me.
