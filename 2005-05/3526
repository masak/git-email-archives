I don't mind switching it to GPL v2 if I'm allowed to.  I kept LGPL v2.1 
for that file since that's the license used for xdiff where significant 
portion of that file has been copied from.

In fact I think the code in that file might be simplified even further 
eventually, at which point there  might not be much of the original code 
left anymore and the license switched to GPL v2.  But in the mean time 
someone else with better knowledge of GPL vs LGPL interaction is needed 
to give advice.
