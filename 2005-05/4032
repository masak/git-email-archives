My _kernel_ is 64-bit, but my user-space is all 32-bit because (a) I don't
care about user-space and (b) I'm lazy and (c)  all the distributions
contain just 32-bit programs and a ppc64 kernel has no trouble running
32-bit programs.

I can compile a kernel with "-m64", but since I don't have any 64-bit
libraries installed, user space doesn't work that well ;)
