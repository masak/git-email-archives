You know how that stuff works? :) It is a very nice idea for
small stuff, but it uses a <div> for every pixel/line you draw and
places this in the background and I expect it to kill your browser if
you try to draw things like gitk does.

Did you look at gitk? With a all the crossing and long lines, you definitely
need to draw the lines with colors. Otherwise you will see _nothing_, but
random characters. :)

Well, you see a list of files which contain the text, not the text
itself. I can print the filename in red. :)

Thanks,
