Dear diary, on Thu, May 19, 2005 at 05:29:52PM CEST, I got a letter
where Sebastian Kuzminsky <seb@highlab.com> told me that...

Does this manpage actually belong to man1? What about git(7) or
something? It's not an actual command.


Not directly related to this problem, but just FYI - git isn't staying
as part of Cogito forever, actually I think its time in Cogito
distribution is running over soon (now that I've pushed all the interesting
local changes to git-pb, consequently to git-linus).

So you will have to either bundle it manually in the distribution
packages, or provide a separate git package for cogito to depend on
(when the unbundling really happens).  Either way, this is git issue,
not cogito. :-)
