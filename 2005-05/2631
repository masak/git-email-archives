Enough with the dates already. I don't want to be doing snapshots
against 2.6.11.9 just because that happened to get tagged more recently
than 2.6.12-rc4. Time is an illusion; especially so when looking at
branches which may not even have been merged.

The tag I want is the one which refers to a commit which is made by
yourself and is accessible from the current HEAD in the lowest number of
steps. And I don't _care_ if you tagged it 'Woozy Numbat'.
