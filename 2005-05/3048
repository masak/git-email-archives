A bit harsh Petr.

Isn't the idea of using an already written tool that you don't _have_ to
parse it?
Where, consistently, do the cg-files have a 1 line summary.

Actually there is :)
asciidoc won't produce a manpage without it.

Yes - if you happen to have written and breathed the code - not so
useless if you're a normal user.

It cogito is ever installed as part of a distro (maybe even by default)
then it would be nice if "man cg-add" actually mentioned it was part of
cogito and git...

Having worked hard on being consistent throughout the git docs I'd say
that a little excess verbiage in the comments is a worthwhile price. I
don't think you can worry about performance or anything - these _are_
shell scripts!


Maybe you'd be happier if they were moved to the bottom of the file and
preceded with:

#asciidoc follows

Or if you don't like that then maybe keep them external.
