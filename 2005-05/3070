Aarg. Did you ever get in contact with QA departements ?

Assume you have:  bugfix - stable - devel repositories.

You have to track down a problem in bugfix and the source of it.
It does not matter whether the maintainer of "bugfix" pulled it from
devel or from stable. It's his fault anyway. 

But we are not talking about faults and guiltiness. We want to identify
the location and the context _where_ and _why_ this change was created.

The current solution of git makes it impossible to retrieve this
information in a consistent way. 

So you have no quick solution to figure out what happened. Quite
contrary, you have to dissect inconsistent information.

See also the thread about "Stop git-rev-list at sha1 match".

This sentence makes me guess, that you actually are working in a QA
departement and therefor trying to maximize the amount of irrelevant
information.
