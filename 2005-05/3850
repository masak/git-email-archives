I now consider all files in a commit, and all commits in a branch to 
determine the ancestor, and only report it in the first commit on the 
branch.

Strangely, you have to look at (potentially) all commits on a branch to 
find the 'true' ancestor branch.

The problem is for branch-off-branch branches where the first commit on 
the new branch modifies only files never modified on the branch-off-HEAD 
branch.  This is because cvs only REALLY creates the branch when the 
first commit is made (for that file) on the branch.  Before that, it is 
just a 'potential' branch...

But I have code now which (seems to) works, but needs a bit more checking.

Yes.
