What you're missing is that time is only important in this case to deduce
the relative age of each commit LOCALLY.   The intention of this proposal
is not to allow time comparison of commits between repositories.  In fact,
you'll see if you look closely, that you don't need to do that in order to
solve the stated problem of sorting the commits by the time they were
merged LOCALLY.

Cheers,
Sean
