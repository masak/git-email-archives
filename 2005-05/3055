Dear diary, on Thu, May 12, 2005 at 12:20:10AM CEST, I got a letter
where David Greaves <david@dgreaves.com> told me that...

Sorry, I didn't mean to sound (too) harsh. ;-)

No, the idea is to get nice output while keeping the input easily human
readable. I'm only stretching that further, since we know more than
asciidoc itself does about the file. :-)

I can't parse this sentence, I fear. All the cg-files have a 1 line
summary, then one or more copyright lines, then the description 'n
stuff. That's fixed format, much like the git commit format.

So the script piping this to asciidoc can add this at the proper point.

Sorry, I've meant only the "cg-add is part of Cogito, an SCM-like
toolkit for managing GIT trees" part is useless.

Yes. I'm fine with it being in the manpage. I just don't want it in the
code since again, it is obvious there. And code (be it program code or
documentation code) duplication is wrong, if you have a non-trivial
chunk repeated over and over everywhere, you probably want to move it to
a single place. That'd be the conversion script here.
