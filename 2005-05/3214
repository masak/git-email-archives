That's what the:
zerosep=$'-d "\0"'
is for.
It looks like the shell 'read' doesn't honour it though - I couldn't
make it work.

However, thanks, after I fixed the quotes I missed in:
-o \( $pass_files -eq 1 -a -f "$file" \) \
-o \( $pass_dirs -eq 1 -a -d "$file" \) \
-o \( $pass_links -eq 1 -a -h "$file" \) \

it handles all cases above except \n (of course)

Frankly I think we're beyond shell programming and we should be using
perl (IMHO as the 'best' and most portable text handler)
It also has a *fantastic* test harness available.
