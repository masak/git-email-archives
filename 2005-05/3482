I took the liberty of doing just that. The only subtle issue was that 
the strbuf functions would consider an empty line to be EOF, which looked 
wrong and unintentional. Fixing that made the actual diff-helper changes 
totally trivial, and I can now do

	git-rev-list HEAD | git-diff-tree -r -v --stdin | ./git-diff-helper -r | less -S

and it does the right thing for me.
