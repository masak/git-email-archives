Dear diary, on Tue, May 03, 2005 at 09:35:36PM CEST, I got a letter
where Chris Wright <chrisw@osdl.org> told me that...

For now, I do it so seldom that I just manually do

	cg-log >Changelog
	cg-export ~/cogito-0.9
	cp Changelog ~/cogito-0.9
	cd ~
	tar cvvfz cogito-0.9.tar.gz cogito-0.9

OTOH, I'd like to change this all to just

	cg-export ~/cogito-0.9.tar.gz

when I get to merge the relevant patches; I'm not sure there is so much
of a value to bundle the Changelog; just get the git tree and do cg-log
on your own, or use the web interface.

I might however have some private mkrelease.sh script which would do

	echo "$1" >VERSION
	update-spec-file
	echo "$1" | cg-commit
	cg-tag "$1"

or something.


BTW, did you have a particular reason to split the .spec file updates to
three parts? I think it doesn't make much sense and it'd be probably
enough to update it at once, when we are not doing it at the right time
anyway.
