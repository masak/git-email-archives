... which makes me feel that, since you cannot be anal enough
anyway, it would be more consistent not to be more restrictive
than necessary (the user has every right to screw himself
anyway).

No matter what you end up doing, you would need something like
this as well (I am not screening .git here but that should be
easy for you to add).

------------
Allow dot files in ls-files as well.
