Hi folks,

In Cogito, it would be nice to have a

cg-seek +

that would seek to the next archive state. This way, I could start off seeking
back to the beginning of an archive, and quickly step forward, looking at files
as I went, to the present.

A corresponding
cg-seek -
would go the reverse direction, back toward the beginning of a project.

I'm not sure how useful this would be for actual source code - I suspect any
benefit would be minimal - but the benefit for documentation and text files,
where the only way to test improvements is to read them by eye, would be
significant.

Be well,
Zack
