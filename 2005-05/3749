The machine readable format has the same issue: it needs to be able to 
distinguish between a "copy" (where the source remains) and a "rename" 
(where the source is removed). So you still need the "*/-" thing, and then 
you're better off doing "+" and "/" too in the machine-readable format, to 
make the differences be as small as possible _and_ to avoid confusion if a 
pathname starts with '*' or '-'.
