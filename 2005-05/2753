I think it looks a little bit squeezed, but I don't mind at all. Maybe
using 72 is a good idea. However it is only cosmetic and I can change it
to use the fmt default.

What do you think about a special flag for automatic merging (which
makes the commit message say "Automatic merge") and a .cogitorc file
like .cvsrc where you can choose the default method.

I am using a lot of temporary trees where I pull a lot of kernel
subsystems together and I don't need that "feature" there.

I will check what I can do, but I don't really care that much about the
patch size ;)

I thought so. Is using cogito.XXXXXX and cogito.temp.XXXXX fine with
you?

That is not mess. Think about it. If we have messages provided by -m we
want an empty line between the merge message and the the first commit
message. And we don't wanna have an extra empty line at the top if you
provide a commit messages via -m.

Marcel
