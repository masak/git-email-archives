let me be more specific. It only works in the fast forward case. If we
actually must merge the trees, because I have local committed changes
and not committed changes, I see this:

link 74966c42ddd874192c318acfc5f013e56c50606a
link b27ddcd47e293557e0605b98b2a1e8429035cdc5
link 568ad7814e266f84b4ac28c15a0cadfb2fdb6c80
Tree change: f345b0a066572206aac4a4f9a57d746e213b6bff:74966c42ddd874192c318acfc5f013e56c50606a
:100644 100644 f5deac7be59e7eeab8657fd9ae706fd6a57daed2 568ad7814e266f84b4ac28c15a0cadfb2fdb6c80 M      README

Applying changes...
usage.c: needs update
cg-merge: merge blocked: local changes

I changed the README in test1 repository and committed it. Then I
changed Makefile in test2 repository and committed it. After that I
modified usage.c and left it uncommitted. Then I pulled in the README
change from test1 repository.

Regards

Marcel
