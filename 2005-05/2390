Linus, 

    git-diff-cache without --cached says 'U filename" (or
"unmerged filename") when working with an unmerged cache entry.
Since the form without --cached is to mean "look at the work
tree", I think it should be changed to report the mode and the
magic 0{40} SHA1.  What do you think?

I was manually fixing up a merge and I wanted to compare the
merge result in the work tree with the pre-merge HEAD version
from either heads, but this behaviour (yes I am the guilty one)
makes it cumbersome, and that is the reason behind this
question.

BTW, when you have a chance, could you please give the
executable bit to git-apply-patch-script, pretty please.  This
is my fourth attempt ;-).
