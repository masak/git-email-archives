Sure. I'll apply this one and merge in Junio's rename on top of it, but I 
wanted to verify one thing first:

I don't know the different LGPL versions, so can somebody verify that LGPL
2.1 is fully compatible with GPLv2...

In fact I'd prefer to have that notice in the code to make it obvious that 
the LGPL becomes the GPLv2 when linked into the rest of git.
