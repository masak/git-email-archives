Ok, I just committed this. Almost all commands that take SHA1 strings from 
the command line can now use the shortened format. 

Right now it only does the "filename" version, and it tries to append 
".git/" to it if it doesn't work, so you can do

	git-diff-cache HEAD

or something like that if you want to. Where ".git/HEAD" would also have
worked, or ".git/refs/heads/master" (or just "refs/heads/master").

For example, if you have a refs/tags directory which has been populated 
with files that point to the tags, you can do

	git-diff-tree -p refs/tags/v2.6.12-rc3 HEAD

and it will do exactly what you'd expect it to do.

I didn't do the ".p1" for parent thing. It would be easy to add, I just 
haven't decided on a nice syntax for it (I'd like something that is nice 
and doesn't need quoting, but the ".p1" seems a bit _too_ ugly).
