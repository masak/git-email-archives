I was waiting for comments on this set in case there were comments like:
every document should have 'x' or change all 'y' to 'z'
I fully intend to split it out...

I will send patches next time.

One thing I failed to mention.
There's a minor bug in asciidoc for which I've submitted a patch to the
author. IIRC the bug causes problems with the -man option and is
cosmetically wrong with the html.

>From the asciidoc docs:
The first manpage section is mandatory and must be called /NAME/ and
contain a single paragraph (usually a single line) consisting of a list
of one or more comma separated command name(s) separated from the
command purpose by a dash character. **The dash must have at least one
white space character on either side.**

However this is not enforced (or indeed possible) at the moment - the
NAME section seems to split on the first hyphen.

This patch fixes that for me.
