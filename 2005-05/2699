Nope. That's just stupid. 

Use the whole commit history, and if you want to simplify it from there
once you notice that some branches end up never being interesting, then
that's ok.

But trying to be clever while building this up is just crazy talk. When
diff-tree prints out the changes, it has no way of knowing what the
context around it was - it doesn't know about merges far away, and it
_shouldn't_ know.
