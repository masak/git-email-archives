Wait a minute.  Aren't we scanning starting from the first
'---\n'?  Why does what's in commit message matter?

And it is not really "Mode change" anymore.  If you used to have
file there and you replaced it with a symlink, that is 100644 to
120000 "mode change".  I experimented with different things in
where I have "# mode: " there and seriously considered to spell
it "# git:" instead, because that is not really mode and it is
something that means something special to git.  Also I tried to
say just "@. " --- it _was_ confusing to human eye, especially
if you are used to reading diffs.

What I think is that this should not really matter much for
human consumption, because mode change is rare and type change
is even more rare.

Here is what I'd propose for you to do.  (1) Take the patch as
is and commit; (2) Change the definition of git_prefix in diff.c
to "\n@. " and commit; (3) If you already took the test suite,
match t/t2000-diff.sh for the "\n@. " format, and commit.  

It will look something like this. thanks to the leading newline,
the output becomes a bit less confusing (without that blank
line, it really is a disaster for human eyes).
