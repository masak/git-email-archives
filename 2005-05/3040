Dear diary, on Wed, May 11, 2005 at 03:44:45AM CEST, I got a letter
where Jonas Fonseca <fonseca@diku.dk> told me that...

This is really awful - it carries no interesting information whatsoever
since that is pretty obvious from the fact that it is in file called
cg-add.

Half of this is useless, too.

I think you should just keep the first paragraph of the files as it is
now. Don't touch it, just parse it.

> +#

> +# --------

No need for this heading either.

> +USAGE="cg-add FILE..."
> +#
> +# DESCRIPTION
> +# -----------
>  # Takes a list of file names at the command line, and schedules them
>  # for addition to the GIT repository at the next commit.

Useless.

> +#

> +# -------
> +# No options.

The rest of DESCRIPTION and OPTIONS looks fine.

I'd just expect you to be much less intrusive in the in-file comments
and do more work when processing the stuff. I'm commenting on how it
looks inside of the sources - do whatever is necessary when processing
it to generate a proper-looking manpage from it.
