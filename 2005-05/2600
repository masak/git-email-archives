That's the 2.6.11 tree, which I added to have a previous real release to 
diff against.

Yes. You can make (my) fsck shut up with something like

	refs=.git/refs/*/*
	git-fsck-cache $refs

but that assumes that cogito has been updated to the newer fsck that 
understands to follow tags (not just parse them, but also add the "tag 
refers to object xxx" info to its internal tree of trust). I don't think 
that has happened yet.

In the meantime, just ignore it.
