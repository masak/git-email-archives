zdelta seems to be a research project.  It does compress better than the xdiff 
lib, but the speed improvements against xdiff(1) are probably because the 
resulting tree is smaller.  I favor the xdiff code because it's so much 
smaller, and seems easier for us to maintain.

For performance, there's still quite a bit of tuning that can be done in terms 
of when and how we delta.
