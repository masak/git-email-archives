Dear diary, on Mon, May 09, 2005 at 10:27:09AM CEST, I got a letter
where Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org> told me that...

so what? I still think the idea is cool, why shouldn't support it if
noone else does?

The only thing to watch out for is that cg-commit -C produces no such
list at all; it should deal with that and tell the user he is not going
to be able to control what is going to be committed then.

Another thing is that at the moment you modify the file list, you should
set customfiles - otherwise you will commit even cg-adds and cg-rms of
files you didn't select. But do that really only when you change the
file list, since it is more expensive.

You should also place an appropriate hint near the CG: lines, saying
that removing some of them will limit the list of files to be committed.
