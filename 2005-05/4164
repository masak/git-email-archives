This smells to me like a "cool feature, because we can" rather than a
"this is useful because of xxx".

You could equally well do it with 

	git-diff-cache .. | sort-filenames | git-diff-helper

in porcelain, if somebody really wants this (but I can't see people 
clamoring for it, since nobody else has ever done soemthing like this, 
afaik).

In other words: what is the problem this is trying to solve?
