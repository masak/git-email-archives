Dear diary, on Tue, May 03, 2005 at 10:03:05PM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> told me that...
> Hello!

Hello,

> So, cg-init created an empty .git/refs/heads/master and made .git/HEAD a
> symlink to it.  Now, commit-id reads that file and gets confused.

my plan is to make cg-init:

(i) automatically add to cache any existing content in the current directory,
    if there is any
(ii) call cg-commit right away

This will make us free of this annoying special case and if you are
importing an existing tree, you want to do this anyway. The only case
when it is not 101% right is when starting a new project from fresh, but
some first "dummy" special commit shouldn't hurt there either (that will
require to modify write-tree to be willing to write an empty tree).

Patches welcome.
