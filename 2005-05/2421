Hmm.. I like the "it's unmerged, so we report it that way" thing, but on 
the other hand, what you describe as your workflow:

This seems to make sense as a workflow perspective, so I guess I'll have 
to agree. A unmerged file that exists in the working tree should probably 
get reported as the working tree version, not as unmerged.

If it's not in the working tree at all, I'd assume that "U" is the right 
thing to do (and obviously, with "--cached" there is no question about 
it).

I just sent you a description of the problem I had with your tree, so 
maybe fifth time lucky..
