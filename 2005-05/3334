Been lurking here, waiting for an announcement of a snapshot of this 
new gismo.  I wgot it, and chmodded it to 0766, but got this when its 
run:
[root@coyote git]# ./gitk-0.91
Error in startup script: can not find channel named "stder"
    while executing
"puts stder "Error executing git-rev-tree: $err""
    invoked from within
"if [catch {set commfd [open "|git-rev-tree $rargs" r]} err] {
        puts stder "Error executing git-rev-tree: $err"
        exit 1
    }"
    (procedure "getcommits" line 8)
    invoked from within
"getcommits $revtreeargs"
    (file "./gitk-0.91" line 993)

Typu?
