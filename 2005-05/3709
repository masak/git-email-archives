In the raw git interfaces, you'd basically have to do the same thing that
"git-pull-script" does, except that _instead_ of calling the
git-resolve-script thing, you'd do

	git-rev-tree MERGE_HEAD ^HEAD | git-diff-tree -v -m -s --stdin

to show what is in the downloaded MERGE_HEAD but not in HEAD.

And again, without the porcelain this is:

	git-diff-tree -v -p <name>

(Basically, you can do _anything_ with "git-diff-tree". For example, you 
want "cg log"? Do

	git-rev-list HEAD | git-diff-tree --stdin -v -m -s

which is basically what "git-whatchanged" does).
