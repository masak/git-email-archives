Yep. Maybe "can't" was a bit too strong. "Should never be" is right.

Come on, you have to fix the spec file for the changelog and version by
hand anyway, autoconfiscating it doesn't help one iota there.

And yes, I've seen quite a few packages autogenerating the spec file. As a
result, you /can't/ build the package from pristine sources, you have to
unpack and configure to get enough for building. For me that just isn't
acceptable, as it completely misses the point of RPM.

(You can go "rpmbuild -ta whatever-2.3.1.tar.bz2" if the tarball is set up
correctly, your idea prevents that).
