I have not measured and I have not studied how the current
mkdelta does things, but if you are not doing so already it may
make sense to keep the later one expanded in full and represent
older ones as delta, since that would give faster access to more
often used items (I am assuming more recent version are likely
to be accessed more frequently, which I believe is what SCMs
typically do.  RCS format is geared towards this AFAICR).
