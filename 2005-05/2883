I'm particularly thinking of when you copy and clone directories, you 
have to define your semantics more specifically.  When do you want to 
*copy* this ID, and when do you want to make sure a new one is created?

One possible answer to that is to have .git/repoid and have it 
auto-created (from /dev/urandom) if it doesn't exist, but I also observe 
that at least two people (davem and pavel) have managed to clone "Linus' 
kernel tree" as their description on http://www.kernel.org/git/ ...
