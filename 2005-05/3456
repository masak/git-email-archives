Assuming that you have something that lets you commit selected
files when you are at the top level (say cg-commit), and further
assuming that today it only works from the toplevel, that is:

    $ pwd
    /usr/src/linux
    $ cg-commit fs/ext?/Makefile

works today, what I am saying is:

    $ pwd
    /usr/src/linux/fs
    $ git-run-with-user-path cg-commit -- ext?/Makefile

would work.

Usually the command like cg-commit would take non-path
parameters, so if this works today:

    $ pwd
    /usr/src/linux
    $ cg-commit -m 'Changed Makefile' fs/ext?/Makefile

then:

    $ pwd
    /usr/src/linux/fs
    $ git-run-with-user-path cg-commit -m 'Changed Makefile' -- ext?/Makefile

would work.

Once you have a core that works well but only at the top
directory level, then you can make a thin wrapper using
git-run-with-user-path to make that work equally well with the
filesystem path from subdirectories.  And the core-ish thing
that only works at the top directory level does not need to
worry about finding .git/ anymore, which is the whole point of
what this helper is giving you.



BTW, I am wondering if your choice of cg-commit as an example
(as opposed to something else like diff or add) is a flamebait
or just an innocent random example ;-)?
