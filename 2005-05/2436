If I understand this mechanics correctly then "master head" always track your 
local tree (i.e. with all remote and local patches applied) and "origin head" 
always tracking head of the remote branch from where you are getting objects.

I.e. it is really a tree, not source of objects. The tree can be strored on 
many different hosts but it is the same across them. But the master tree have 
no source to sync from - you are creating it yourself locally so there is no 
"master branch" - only head.

So if you are just tracking some other tree and do not do any merges/patches 
yourself then your master head will always match your remote source head 
("origin" in most cases).
