Yes. I'm not ahuge fan of the notion of "repo ID's". One reason is that I
actually really really like the notion of anonymous repositories, so that
when I do something stupid, and blow away one of my less successful
repositories and continue with another one, nobody ever sees it (and yes,
this happens - in my BK usage I occasionally cloned my repo for some
testing, and then ended up using the _cloned_ repo for the real work, and
totally blowing away ymy original one, and renamed my cloned one back to
where my main one is).

That said, while I actually think that time/date matters, I don't think it 
should matter a lot.

I don't see why people don't just use the "committer" name for this.  
That's really what you want, and it ends up being a very good
approximation of "repository ID" for a commit. Sure, people end up having
multiple reposiories, and thus you'll occasionally see merges that end up
merging two heads with the same "repo ID", but does anybody really care? I
doubt it.

For example, if you have a company Q&A policy that says that you want to 
keep commits to different repos separate, just make sure that those repos 
are on different machines or are accessed with different users. Or write 
some simple wrapper scripts that make sure to set GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL to 
the proper value (say, the wrapper could be as simple as

	#!/bin/sh
	export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=$(cat .git/committer_email)
	real-git-commit "$@"

and then you just create a ".git/committer_email" file per repository that 
contains the "repo ID" you want to fake.
