Hello!

"make test" fails for current cogito:

*** t4008-diff-break-rewrite.sh ***

* failed 3 among 23 test(s)

The failures happens because the test uses file ../README, which was
changed recently (and therefore, its checksum changed as well).  Also,
this and several other tests refer to ../COPYING, which is going to
change as well (it has an old mailing address of FSF).

I suggest that we use separate test files.  It would be great if those
files included text in several languages to test support for non-ASCII
symbols (maybe HELLO from emacs sources).

Or maybe we could use short files embedded in the scripts.  Or maybe we
could use sed to take significant portions of GPL that don't include
Linus' foreword, any mailing addresses or "19" when it's used as two
first digits of a year.
