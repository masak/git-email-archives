Upon further consideration, I think there are three things that pull
implementation needs to handle:

 1) fetching object files by hash, validating them, and writing them to
    the local objects directory
 2) fetching reference files by name, and making them available to the
    local program without writing them to disk at all.
 3) fetching other files by name and writing them to either the
    corresponding filename or a provided replacement.

I had thought that (2) could be done as a special case of (3), but I think
that it has to be separate, because (2) just returns the value, while
(3) can't just return the contents, but has to write it somewhere, since
it isn't constrained to be exactly 20 bytes.

So I think I'd like to do essentially the original series, slightly
rearranged and with a few edits, and then add (3) afterwards; this should
be easy once the rpush/rpull changes to make the protocol extensible are
in place.

I'll also do additional (independant) patches to provide an expected
starting point and lock things appropriately.
