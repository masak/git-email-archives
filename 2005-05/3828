Yup. I think it's more important to get the rest calmed down again, and 
fix the things that got broken. Sadly, "git-whatchanged -s" was one such 
thing.

(I think that's just because the "silent" test used to depend on the 
magical behaviour of the "header" thing, and now that the header 
generation and suppression is sane, "silent" doesn't work any more)
