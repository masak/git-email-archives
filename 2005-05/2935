Actually the easiest way is to stop reporting the size.  Nobody
else in core GIT reports st.st_size in their error messages.

Although I agree with you that what you say about the size of
st.st_size is correct, in GIT world view, apparently "unsigned
long" is big enough to hold st.st_size all over the code.  Would
you recommend tackling that assumption as well?
