Strictly speaking, don't you need to allow multiple "supercedes" lines
to cover all the cases?  The pathological case is when you've got
multiple trees all with different variants of the same tag name, and you
try to merge them all at once with a multi-parent commit.  

Sure, tags refer to trees, not commits, so you don't necessarily have to
do this tag resolution at commit time (indeed, since commits don't refer
to tags, you *can't* do that resolution atomically on commit.)

But if you do pull tags into the local .git/refs/tags on merge, then you
will want to either resolve the conflict or supercede those tags, and at
that point you've got multiple equally valid tags in the histories that
are being superceded.  Doing so is a porcelain issue, but the core will
still need to understand tags with multiple supercedes: lines.
