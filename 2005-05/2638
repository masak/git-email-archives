Hi,

Do we have anything (making sense) that can visualize a git tree?
I know gitweb.pl but it doesn't do what I want: which is displaying
a tree, displaying diffs between specific parents and childs etc.
Somebody mentioned some monotone (IIRC) util hacked for git - does
that make sense?

If there is none, I'm of course going to write one right now. I was
thinking about *HTML output (so it could be used over Internet with
standard protocol and tools), but the language is missing graphical
operations, right?
