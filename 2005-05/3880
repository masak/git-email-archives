Heh. There's a difference between being anal, and allowing people to shoot 
themselves in the foot.

I'll happily allow people who _try_ to do stupid things to do them ;)

It's the

	find . -type f | cut -d/ -f2- | xargs git-update-cache --add --

kinds of "unintentionally stupid" scripts I want to avoid (and the reason
I do that is because that's basically _exactly_ the script I used when
testing something ;)
