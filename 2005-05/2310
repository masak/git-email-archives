True, but with -p, you'd probably want to give lines like

--- HEAD/Makefile
+++ (cache)/Makefile

when it's not just hex (and "linus/Makefile" for heads/linus, not
"heads/linus/Makefile", which would break things). I think it's generally
best to call each of the things in the list to try and not only use the
first one that understands, but also do program-specific special things
depending on which one that was.

Maybe :p1, to use characters that aren't frequently in filenames?

I agree with that, but I'm not sure how useful having one function that
just looks up the sha1 without further reporting is. In any case, it's an
easy addition, and it's plausible that similar functions would work for
any similar information needed.
