I'd prefer the few and scattered users which don't want arg handling to
explicitly set some magic variable before calling cg-Xlib rather than
adding the arg parser function call everywhere else.

Ok, so what's the outcome? Are you going to stop at this point, or will
you change the scripts so that they use the glob list?
