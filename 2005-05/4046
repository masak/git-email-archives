Kay,
 just a few more quickie suggestions if you don't mind..

 - looking around, the ALSA guys aren't the only ones that start off with 
   an empty line, so it's probably worth fixing the summary etc to ignore 
   whitespace at the beginning rather than give empty summary reasons.

 - any reason to limit the "summary" page to just the last 14 changes? The 
   "log" thing you can ask to go back further, it would be nice to have
   something like a "last 100" thing for summaries too, especially since 
   the summary is so nice and dense, so you can actually get a nice view 
   of what has happened without scrolling _too_ much.

 - I was in the "commitdiff" thing, and initially thought that there was 
   no way to get back to the "summary" view.

   It turns out I was wrong (the summary is reachable by just clicking at
   the project name itself in the top header), but it's a bit strange that
   the "commitdiff" thing has an explicit link back to itself (hey, 
   consistency is good, so I'm not complaining), but the link back to the
   summary page is implicit.

   So how about adding an explicit "summary" link to the list of other 
   explicit links (log, commit, commitdiff and tree) at the top of the 
   page?

I actually like browsing other peoples projects with the gitweb
interfaces, it's both responsive and verbose enough to really say
something good. In contrast, cvsweb is always just a mess of "these are
the files, go at it", which is totally pointless and doesn't tell anything
about what is actually happening in the project.

So dammit, I'm very biased indeed, but I'm just looking at gitweb, and
comparing it to both the CVS and SVN web things, and they just reinforce
my conviction that CVS is absolute crap, and I find myself surprised by
how crap SVN also appears.

[ In other words, while I have all these stupid requests for you, I 
  think gitweb is just _way_ better and more useful than something like
  viewcvs (or cvsweb). So don't mind my small gripes, I only have them 
  because I like this thing.

  On that small note, I also find "gitk" very cool indeed, too bad about 
  the fact that tk/tcl seems to always end up looking so _ugly_. Is there 
  any way to get anti-aliased fonts and a less 'Motify' blocky look from 
  tcl/tk? Every time I see that, I feel like I'm back in the last century  
  or something.

  Combining some of the features of the two (that über-cool revision 
  history graph from gitk rules, for example) might be cool. I get the 
  urge to do octopus-merges in the kernel just because of how good they
  look in gitk ;) ]
