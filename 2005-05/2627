Okay, but that's only true if this is really a problem.
I'm not sure it _is_, in fact I think the semantics make perfect sense.
I just wanted to note that as the kind of change

please speak up!

Is that really a problem, though?  It seems to me that since a
bad merge can be undone, it's not really a problem.
