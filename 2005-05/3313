Do you have any sensible alternatives to "remote:refs/<something>" in
mind? I suppose that "remote:HEAD" would also work. How are you thinking
of having the value get written locally?

Do you also have some idea for user-invoked rpush? It has to call
something that writes the value on the other side (and I'd ideally like it
to do the update atomically and locked against other clients). This series
uses the same mechanism to write it that it uses to write hashes fetched
from remote machines.
