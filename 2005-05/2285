I've been working on http-pull, and I've made it able to download the
target commit from ...git/refs/<dir>/<name> (instead of making you figure
it out yourself), and also write the target it looks up to your local
.git/refs/<w-d>/<w-n> (which doesn't have to be at all related to the
source one. In fact, I just got the latest Linus tree with:

git-http-pull -t -w heads/linus heads/master \
  http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
git-read-tree $(cat .git/refs/heads/linus)
git-checkout-cache -a
git-update-cache --refresh

(and I didn't get any of the history, although I could have if I wanted
to; and I could get it now if I decided I needed it).

My question is, where does this belong? It's based on adding to the core
as it has been the knowledge that .git/refs/*/* consists of hex-format
hash files, both locally and on remote servers. I think this level of
information belongs in the plumbing; at least, if people are to be able to
use different git-based systems to access the same repositories, they have
to agree. And there seems to be that much agreement, and so it makes sense
to make it part of the core.

(For that matter, people seem to agree that refs/heads/ has heads, and
refs/heads/master is the one you want to pull if you don't know
otherwise; I didn't include this information at all)
