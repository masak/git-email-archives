It looks like it'll be most painless when I just reinvent parts of your
patch here locally and you can send me patches on top of that.

I'm sorry but I still don't get what are you trying to say. :-)
As far as I can see, the output will be the same, except that with to -m

I'll just drop this chunk. :-)
