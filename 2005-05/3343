Dear diary, on Sun, May 15, 2005 at 05:53:15PM CEST, I got a letter
where Zack Brown <zbrown@tumblerings.org> told me that...

I think it's actually very BKish. Each repository has its own "master"
branch, which always corresponds with your current branch of
development. That is, your working tree is always represented by the
"master" branch.

The rest of branches are "remote", that is they just point at the other
repositories. When you want to get the new changes from them, you
cg-pull, or cg-update to merge them to your branch too.

So if you want to create a new branch, you cg-clone the original branch.
And if you want to refer to the new branch in any other branch, you
cg-branch-add it in the other branch.

So the local branch is the "master" branch, the rest are "remote"
branches. Note that there is a theoretical support for multiple local
branches, but I decided not to make things even more confusing and there
is no Cogito interface for managing them now.

I will add cg-switch which will switch the master branch to some other
branch (e.g. cg-switch linus will rename your current master to
master-1234 or something, update your "origin" branch to point to the
"linus" branch, and make your "master" branch to point at the same
commit as the "origin" branch). I might also do something like
cg-branch-add --local, which will add a local branch and you could then
cg-switch to it too.
