So the main reason I _don't_ like programs that automatically look up the 
refs etc is that its' often simply WRONG.

For example, if I want to know what objects I have in my object directory 
that are needed for a release, I want to be able to tell fsck to list the 
objects that are extraneous for that release _regardless_ of the fact that 
I may have .git/refs/*/* files that point to other things.

So if fsck-cache automatically looks up references in .git/refs/ like in
one of your earlier patches, then instead of adding value to the program,
you actually _remove_ value from it by making it less flexible, and
enforcing a world-view that is not necessarily the only view.

This is why I want the true _plumbing_ to not care about these things, and 
if you include references to trees, you _list_ them explicitly. 

And if you want to have a command that takes implied references, then just 
make a script that does that for you, rather than making the core plumbing 
understand it.

This is a classic "ease of use" vs "power-user" issue. I'm very
fundamentally of the opinion that power-users are good, and that ease of
use is done by having scripts that turn normal ops into "power user"  
operations.

That's the unix way, really.
