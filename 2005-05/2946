I tend to agree that a generic 'content tracking system' shouldn't
impose this kind of rule.
Requiring well formed filenames (eg no //, no trailing /s) is fine - but
dot-file-discrimination?

When I first saw it, I expected this kind of rule to (eventually) be
lifted from the plumbing to the porcelain. The minor problem is that
Linus seems to like getting his hands dirty and keeps using the plumbing ;)
(eek - these analogies...)
