You're talking about something else - you worry about showing a graph, for 
example.

What git-rev-list A B does is literally for something like a "changelog" -
what commits were added in A that weren't in B, and the list is A, C and
D. Or, more commonly, used for something like

	git-rev-list HEAD v2.6.12-rc5 | git-diff-tree --stdin -v -p drivers/usb

which basically says "what changed since 2.6.12-rc5 in the drivers/usb 
tree"?

So in that situation, you really do _not_ want to see B and E, even if
you'd need those two to make all the connections. Because you've seen B
and E already (they were in v2.6.12-rc5), and if you're looking for a bug
that didn't happen in that release, you really only want to see the new
stuff.
