I was primarily responding to your idea of it being outside the scope of
cogito as well as outside the core.

My reasons for having it in the core are as follows:

 - All of the porcelain layers have to, at least, agree as to how this is
   represented in order for repositories to be portable; since the
   representation is common, it might as well be core.

 - There are currently no special files which are tracked for cogito (et 
   al) to put the information in.

 - Ideally, the dependancy would only be per-commit, not per-tree; if Petr
   releases a new cogito which only merges a new mainline with the git-pb,
   the cogito tree object should be the same (since the cogito content
   didn't change). This means that it can't be anywhere other than the
   commit.

 - If the solution to the issue of finding the necessary git-pb is to
   store it with cogito, then the programs that pull from this repository
   need to know that they need to pull the git-pb portion, and fsck-cache
   needs to know that the cogito references the git-pb.
