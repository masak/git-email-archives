  Hello,

  I've published the git-pb git tree. This is a purely "core GIT" tree,
with no traces of Cogito itself inside, and intended to be safe-to-pull
for Linus. It will hopefully be soon fully synchronized by the GIT part
of the Cogito tree (it already has all the important bits), and will
stay so - any GIT stuff will go to the Cogito tree through the git-pb
tree.

  I plan to integrate the well-looking core git patches flying through
the mailing list to the git-pb tree, as well as various own stuff
(related or not related to what Cogito needs for operating well).  I
will be pulling from Linus on regular basis, and from git-jc too if I
feel comfortable with what's inside.

  I'm also thinking about git-pbc for the possibly controversial stuff
(taking care of hidden files, perhaps librarifications).


  You get it as a Git tree at

	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/git-pb.git
	http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/cogito/git-pb.git


  On related note, I've set up a Git->CIA gateway. CIA is a commit
aggregator, tracking large number of open source projects. Cogito's and
git-pb's corner is at http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/Cogito, the
commits are also broadcasted to the #git OPN channel (which is the point
of the whole thing, after all ;-).


  Have fun,
