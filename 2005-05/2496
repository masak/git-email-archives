Please ignore this patch for now.  It turn out that the repositories
with only "origin" branch don't get updated properly by cg-update.
Changes don't get merged, so cg-cancel need to be run after cg-update.

It looks like that the "master" branch is needed, although it's not
documented anywhere.  Or maybe we need some further changes to support
origin-only repositories.  In any case, changing cg-init is not
sufficient.
