It can in principle, yes. This is the so-called Java-Native-Interface (JNI).

I think in the longer term it would make sense to write a JNI layer
but the GIT source code is probably a little too unstable for that
now. What needs to happen first, I think, is that a solid and stable C
API (e.g. a libgit) be proposed and developed.

One outcome of the work I am doing (a long time away, probably will
never happen) might eventually be to propose an C API for GIT based,
in part, on the prototyping work I do in Java. However, I suspect its
Java-tainted heritage would mean instant death to it for purely
dogmatic reasons so I think it I'll leave it to others to propose a
C-API and then write a JNI wrapper for that when/if it ever happens.

Agreed.
