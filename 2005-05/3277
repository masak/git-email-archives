Dear diary, on Sat, May 14, 2005 at 12:58:04PM CEST, I got a letter
where Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com> told me that...

I'd prefer this to be functionality builtin to cg-log and cg-mkpatch.
Perhaps some

	cg-log -m $branch2 [$branch1]

to show stuff in branch2 not yet merged to branch1.
