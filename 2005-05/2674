When I said 'show' I meant merely provide sufficient information. 

I believe that what you get at the moment from the command you showed is
an unconnected list of commits, each of which may be in different
branches, where the _parent_ of each commit you show may not even be
included in the list. 

I.e. you're giving them a bag of unconnected objects which each look
something like this...

		 (COMMIT)--> 
or
		 (COMMIT)--->
		         \-->


But you need to give them a _graph_...

	/------> (COMMIT) --> (COMMIT) --\
 (COMMIT)                                 -> (COMMIT) 
	\-----------> (COMMIT) ----------/

Leaving the pretty GUI as an exercise for the reader is fine. But we do
actually have to give enough information to allow them to connect the
bits together.

My recursive script attempted this but wasn't quite good enough -- we
had enough information to track _merges_ but not _branches_. Hence I was
only giving this much information...

	/------> (COMMIT) --> (COMMIT) --\
 (COMMIT)                                 -> (COMMIT) 
	              (COMMIT) ----------/

(...or this one, depending on which order I parsed the tree...)

	         (COMMIT) --> (COMMIT) --\
 (COMMIT)                                 -> (COMMIT) 
	\-----------> (COMMIT) ----------/
