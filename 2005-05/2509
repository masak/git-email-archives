Whether you use an explicit "dev" type or an implicit "dev" type that 
calls itself "blob" and uses a magic mode flag to tell checkout that it 
needs special treatment doesn't make a difference (whatever you 
prefer, really). I was only trying to make the point that hashes should remain 
hashes and not become a placeholder for minors/majors. However, as 
somebody already suggested, the entire issue is probably moot. When was the last 
time you tried to version control /dev? ;)
