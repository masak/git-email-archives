That is already fixed a few days ago, but unfortunately only in my devel
version. After the catch-up on the recent format changes of the git-output,
I need to wait now until the new git-binaries are hitting kernel.org.

Yes, I recognized that too. Jeff asked for branches and I did the summary
page just for the branches. :) With that I realized that the dense log of the
summary is sometimes nicer than the full log. How about this:
  http://ehlo.org/~kay/gitweb.cgi?p=git/git.git;a=shortlog

It is reachable on the summary page by clicking in the title of the
shortlog.

Well, yes I was trying to get a navigation which is not changing with
every new page... It's not an active link now. Maybe that's better.

Done! That was easy. It will show up on kernel.org when the actual
git-binaries are installed.

Good to hear that. It's a long road to make software from "working" to
"nice to use". That was probably never the goal of some SCM-web-interfaces. :)

I would like to show something like the graph too, but I don't really know
how to do this in html. Seems slippery if not impossible.
If anybody has a nice idea how to represent that, I will give it a try.
