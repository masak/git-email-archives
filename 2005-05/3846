Ok, this seems to be a cvsps bug, and I'll treat it as such. David, any 
ideas? It seems to be because of how cvsps sorts things by date, which is 
obviously bogus.

The cvs2git thing wouldn't normally even _care_ (ie would happily re-order
the thing), but for the fact that it causes problems with branches that
are used before they are created in this case.

cvsps really should do some kind of topo-sort. Probably doesn't need a lot
(ie it probably doesn't even need to be topological, but the "order"  
should be based on trivial dependencies first, and time second. For
example, once David does the per-commit branch handling, I suspect enough
of an ordering to keep git happy falls out of that).

Ok, I'll check it out. I didn't figure out what characters are 
shell-expanded by "<<EOF" handling, and only did '$' because that showed 
up in the syslinux archives.

In theory, they should give the exact same results, no? At least if there 
are no binary objects. Of course, you'd have to update your import script 
to do the times the same way.
