You can apply some heuristic guessing to detect fast forward heads, but
at the very end you will end up with manual selection puzzles.

On one hand we keep care to track the source of a change in the kernel
code by adding signed,acked but on the other hand we don't care about
history correctness. If you look at some file revisions, which you read
from the tree history then you just have patches applied in the wrong
order. 

Maybe nobody cares, but for maintaining customer trees with a bugfix,
stable and experimental branch it's necessary to keep track of
information in a consistent way especially if you have to deal with the
QA department.

I know that there is no simple and fool proof solution for this problem,
but some band-aid to make the reconstruction of history simpler would be
not too bad.
