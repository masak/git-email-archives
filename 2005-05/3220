Yes, my post does assume that you're pulling everything and the repo you're 
pulling from has a sane state.  This should be the common case though, so I 
would suggest optimizing things to build a list of the delta objects and 
check them at the end to see if we didn't pull any.

We want the list of delta objects regardless, this way we can warn the user 
that they have pulled in deltas and give them the chance to convert them into 
full files.
