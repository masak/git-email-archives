(2) is what is needed if the user just requests downloading objects
starting with a reference stored remotely, and doesn't request that the
reference be written anywhere. It is also useful because the system wants
to verify that it has actually downloaded the objects successfully before
writing the reference.

Note that the scripts see a higher-level interface; these are the
operations that (e.g.) http-pull.c has to provide for pull.c, which builds
a larger operation (determine the target hash, download the objects, write
the specified ref file) out of them. It would be inconvenient for pull.c 
to download to a temporary file and then read the temporary file, which
shouldn't normally be visible yet, to figure out what it's doing. It wants
to have a function that takes a string and returns a hash, getting the
value from the remote host, and it's inconvenient to deal with the disk in
the middle.
