What you said above _is_ exactly my intention.  I phrased that
comment very badly.  It should have said:

    /* We _will_ put the "ignore logic Porcelain layers agree upon"
     * here, once we have a concensus.
     *
     * The code should return non-zero if path is to be ignored.
     */

I did not put any implementation there because I do not think we
have agreed upon anything yet.  This patch is to establish
the framework.  

The second patch is separate, because it is _my_ version of the
ignore logic proposal, to serve as a sample.  Whatever ignore
logic is agreed upon, that _will_ be in the place you pointed
out and there will be no choice.  Everybody _will_ use the
ignore logic.

PB> And why is this in the library?

Why not?  It is something other programs would eventually find
useful.

Also the second patch, a sample implementation of ignore logic I
proposed, wants to know GIT_PROJECT_TOP to figure out the file
pointed at by GIT_DIR/.git/info/ignore-file.

Also it would not hurt if you are always running from the
project top and give only verify_path() approved paths.  Then
canon_path would become identity function.

git-run-with-user-path is useful both in implementing
porcelain-add if the porcelain's policy is to take filesystem
paths not GIT paths, like this:

    #!/bin/sh
    # porcelain-add
    exec git-run-with-user-path git-update-cache --add -- -- "$@"

Also if the porcelain's policy is to take GIT paths not
filesystem paths, then users can say:

    $ find . ! -type d -print0 |
      xargs -0 git-run-with-user-path cg-add --

You cannot use both for obvious reasons.
