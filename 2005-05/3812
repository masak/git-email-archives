Indeed.

A few weeks ago (for the previous round of "what should the diff format 
be" discussions) I looked at what "diffstat" does to figure out what the 
name should be, and it's quite disgusting.

The sad part is that if it wasn't for the date that GNU diff puts out, 
we'd be ok (since only GNU diff historically did unified diffs). Then we'd 
just know that the filename ends at the newline, and screw people who use 
newlines in filenames.

Now, we can fix this for git-diffs, and make sure that we don't make that 
mistake, but that just covers git users.
