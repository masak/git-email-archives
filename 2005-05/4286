Dear diary, on Mon, May 30, 2005 at 09:25:41PM CEST, I got a letter

This is strange. I've just did a cg-update on a kernel tree I've left
untouched for more than a week (and I've even locally modified one file)
and everything went fine.

That's entirely possible given the big output format changes from some
git tools. Hopefully most of those problems should be already fixed.

Tip of the day: cg-cancel will fix almost any working state messup (any
messup as long as you have proper commit id in your refs/heads/master
file).
