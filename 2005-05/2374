Dear diary, on Sat, Apr 30, 2005 at 02:53:22AM CEST, I got a letter
where Zack Brown <zbrown@tumblerings.org> told me that...

Yes.

You might want to write some special notes regarding the merge, e.g.
when you want to describe some non-trivial conflict resolution, or even
give a short blurb of the changes you are merging.

If you don't know what to say, just press Ctrl-D. The first line of the
commit always says "Merge with what_you_are_merging_with".

> I'm doing is updating my tree to be current. Why should I have to 'commit' that
> update?

If you are only updating your tree to be current, you don't have to
commit, and in fact you don't commit (you do so-called "fast-forward
merge", which will just update your HEAD pointer to point at the newer
commit). You commit only when you were merging stuff (so-called "tree
merge"; well, that's at least how I call it to differentiate it from the
fast-forward merge). That means you have some local commits over there -
I can't just update your tree to be current, sorry. That would lose your
commit. I have to merge the changes into your tree through a merge
commit.

> Now I look at 'cg-pull'. What does this do? The readme says something about

cg-pull does the first part of cg-update. It is concerned by fetching
the stuff from the remote repository to the local one. cg-merge then
does the second part, merging the stuff to your local tree (doing either
fast-forward or tree merge).
