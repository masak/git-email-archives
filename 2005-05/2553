I suspect there's a 95% point which is easily achieved, &
beyond that it's not clear it's worth it.

I recall seeing several source code directories that actually use symlinks
in their source, and thus would want them preserved by the SCM.
(Not arguing that's the BEST plan, merely an observation).
As this discussion has noted, that wouldn't be hard to add symlink
support to git, and WOULD be helpful for its primary purpose as SCM support.

Once you're there, it wouldn't be hard to add logic to add options to
(1) record the REAL permission bits, (2) record "." files, and
(3) recover the permission bits.  That would be enough to
store & recover in a distributed way a single person's home directory.
THAT might be darn useful, for those of us who float between
different systems & would like to use a single system for multiple purposes.
That's clearly beyond the scope of a typical SCM, but since
it's easy to get there, that'd make sense.

I'm ambivalent about supporting dev, uid/gid, and mtime, and how
it should be done; that may be beyond the "worth it" step.
