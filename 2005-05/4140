Dear diary, on Sun, May 29, 2005 at 09:41:03AM CEST, I got a letter

Yes, I'm talking about the latter.

When I do just cg-diff to see what I changed I usually do not pipe it to
less, and typing that / stuff seems insane (although /^d.* could give a
good approximation). OTOH I think I'll go for the diff output
colorification (at the Cogito level), so the separator indeed isn't
strictly necessary. I can live without it. :-)
